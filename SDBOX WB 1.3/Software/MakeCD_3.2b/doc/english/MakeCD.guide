Please note that this manual is still in beta state. If you understand
German, you'd better use the German manual instead.

Most of the other parts are translated, but we did not have enough
time to spell check them. But this should not be a problem for you.
Thank you for your understanding and your patience. We will release a
final English manual for MakeCD as soon as we are finished.

Crack Warning:
     We have been sent some "100 % cracked" versions of MakeCD which
     did not function properly. Instead, they pretend to work, but with
     totally unpredictable results. Please do not use these versions
     and do not blame us if they cause you untold damage! Be smart and
     download the slightly restriction version from the MakeCD
     homepage: `http://makecd.core.de/'

     We rely on your registrations to continue the development of
     MakeCD. Please bear in mind that we spend a lot of time working on
     MakeCD. When testing new drivers, we often end up with a huge pile
     of coasters to ensure that it does not happen to you! Please
     support us so that we can support MakeCD and the Amiga. Nobody is
     driving around in Ferraris! Without your registration, we cannot
     continue development.

Registered Users:
     Never use cracked/modified versions of MakeCD. Instead, unlock
     unmodified versions using your registration number.

Test Binaries:
     You can check the key MakeCD binaries for any tampering by a
     virus/cracker. Please be aware that the virus/cracker (an
     irresponsible person) may have changed our `CRCList-binaries'.
     These are @{B}not@{UB} covered by the test. For a more comprehensive test,
     check the PGP signature on `CRCList-binaries'. You can find the
     PGP public key file on our home page.

     Please carry out the binary test @{B}before@{UB} you register MakeCD in the
     registration window (since registering will alter the binaries!).

                         >>> @{"TEST" SYSTEM "Run Execute //briktest-from-doc"} MakeCD Binaries! <<<

     Note that you must have started this guide from Workbench in order
     to perform this test, otherwise the test may not find all the
     files and could subsequently fail.

@{B}License Agreement
=================@{UB}

This contract is a legal agreement between you, the end-user, and the
authors of MakeCD. By using the software you are declaring your
agreement to the conditions.

If you are using a @{B}registered@{UB} version of MakeCD with a valid
registration number you are entitled to use @{B}one@{UB} copy of the software on
@{B}one@{UB} single computer with @{B}one@{UB} central unit, at only @{B}one@{UB} place. Even
if you have two (a TAO and a DAO registration number), you @{B}must not@{UB} use
those on two computers, but both @{B}only on one computer at one place@{UB}.

For further details concerning your user rights see @{"Registration fees" Link "LREGF"}.

If you would like to sell a registered version of MakeCD to another
person, we need to be informed by and about @{B}both@{UB} parties involved. We
will then lock the old registration number and charge a processing fee
of 5 DEM plus shipping costs to send the new owner a new registration
number. If you are also registered for DAO, you @{B}must@{UB} sell both the TAO
and DAO numbers at the same time to the same person.

If you are using an @{B}unregistered@{UB} version of MakeCD, you are permitted
to use as many copies as you like and even pass on the software to
other people. However, anyone who uses MakeCD for more than four weeks
@{B}must@{UB} apply for a license, even if that person does not need the
extra functionality of the registered version. There is one exception:
If you use MakeCD @{B}solely@{UB} to play or read CDDA data (in which case you
do not create ISO images or burn CDs), you do not need to register.
However, you are not entitled to technical support in this instance.

An @{B}unregistered@{UB} version of MakeCD is recognized by using the dialog
window that appears when you run the program. The dialog requests the
registration number and the user address. If all the fields are empty,
the version is unregistered. It is safest to pass on the original
(unregistered) archive only.

@{B}Registration
============@{UB}

If you like MakeCD, please be sure to register. We spend a lot of time
and effort developing MakeCD, so please support us.

If the unregistered version of MakeCD does not work with your
configuration, please stop using the program and please do not
register. Some people seem to think that, just because they have
registered, we @{B}have@{UB} to support their system. This is simply not
possible. We try our best to support as many configurations as
possible, but there are some configurations that we @{B}cannot@{UB} support. One
example are systems with SCSI problems. Also, we cannot always obtain
programmer documentation for some CD writers. Since we would like to
have satisfied customers, we strongly encourage you not to register and
then to stop using MakeCD if you are unhappy with the features of the
unregistered version or if MakeCD doesn't work on your system.

If the unregistered version of MakeCD does not support your hardware,
the registered version will not support it either. If this is the case,
wait for updates of MakeCD and register only once you have found an
update that does support your system.

We reserve the right to lock individual registration numbers in later
versions of MakeCD without informing you of the reasons.(1)

Registrations are issued for the current version. The registration
numbers often remain valid for minor updates of MakeCD. Major updates
may require a fee.

@{B}Restrictions in the unregistered version
----------------------------------------@{UB}

The unregistered version has a few built-in restrictions in comparison
to the registered version:

   · You cannot choose the name of the CD-R, nor can you enter the
     "Publisher".

   · You are limited to a maximum of ten tracks per CD-R.

   · In Disc-At-Once (DAO) mode, you can burn in test mode only. (With
     Track-At-Once (TAO) mode, the unregistered version of MakeCD can
     burn in test mode and for real).

Cracked or modified versions of MakeCD often fail to work at all. We
explicitly warn of the use of cracked or modified versions.

@{B}Registration fees
-----------------@{UB}

We feel that UKP 70 to UKP 140 is too high a price for non-commercial
users of MakeCD. Therefore we offer a tier of registration fees so that
you can pick the most cost-effective version that suits your needs.

There are three classes of licensing. The more "commercial" the user of
our software is (and the more money s/he makes with it), the higher
his/her registration fee will be. Non-commercial users pay a small fee
only. Users who burn CDs for a third party and charge for this service
pay a fee in line with the current market prices. Users who have their
mastered CD-ROM's duplicated commercially by a CD manufacturer (often
for commercial sale) pay a fee that has to be negotiated with the
authors individually. We can be flexible with the licensing in this
instance. Please contact us to initiate negotiations!

We fell that the different registration classes try to make the world
of CD-R software a slightly fairer place. Why should a private user,
producing CDs for his/her private use, pay the same fee as a company?

Please bear in mind that we have gone to considerable expense to
develop MakeCD. Your registration fee will help further the development
of MakeCD and secure our dedication to the Amiga platform.

Private User
     Please contact your local dealer for pricing. If you purchase
     directly from the authors in Germany, the fee is DEM 75,- (DAO:
     add 40 DEM).  Audio or data CDs created or burned with MakeCD may
     @{B}only@{UB} be used for your private, non-commercial needs. You must
     not sell CDs that were created or burned with MakeCD. The
     "Publisher" entry cannot be modified and is filled with a standard
     text.

CD Recording Service, Non-Commercial Duplication
     You can purchase only directly from the authors in Germany, the
     fee is DEM 300,-. This is within the current price range for AMIGA
     recording softwares. The recorded CDs may be sold to the respective
     customers who may not re-duplicate them again for commercial
     purposes.  CDs created by MakeCD with this license may not be used
     as masters for pressing CD-ROM's. The "Publisher" entry cannot be
     modified and is filled with a standard text.

CD Manufacturer, Commercial Duplication.
     This license allows you to press CD-Rs with masters created by
     MakeCD. You will also be able to change the "Publisher" entry as
     required. For licensing details including the fee, please contact
     the authors of MakeCD, Angela Schmidt and Patrick Ohly.

The Application-ID field always contains the serial number (which
differs from the cryptic registration number) of the registered
version. Therefore, the authors of MakeCD can determine which
registration number was used for creating data CDs.

A printed manual with over 100 pages (DIN A4) is available for 15 DEM.
If you already are a registered user, you may also order it separately.

Please note that there are shipping costs in addition to the license
fee and/or manual. If you are purchasing the package from the authors
in Germany:

Postage and Packing within Germany
     5 DEM for floppy only, or floppy with printed manual.

Postage and Packing within Europe
     5 DEM for floppy only
     15 DEM for floppy with printed manual.

Postage and Packing outside Europe (Air Mail)
     10 DEM for floppy only
     25 DEM for floppy with printed manual.

Express Delivery
@{B}     Add@{UB} 15 DEM. The registration will be processed immediately and
     sent via Express delivery. Standard registrations are processed
     quickly by Angela's sister -- about once a week, usually over the
     weekend.

     Please note that Katrin takes the occasional holiday, usually
     around Whitsun or in August or September, and the start of
     January. Registrations cannot be processed during these times
     (usually one to three weeks). We apologize for the inconvenience
     caused.

C.O.D. (Germany only)
     Add 9,50 DEM.

You may prefer to purchase MakeCD from your local dealer. Please note
that you must contact the authors directly if the CDs you produce are
not for personal use.

If you wish to purchase MakeCD from the authors in Germany:

A normal MakeCD Private registration without manual will cost 80 DEM
within Europe, including postage and packing. If you also want to use
the DAO feature, it's 120 DEM. Express registration of MakeCD  Private
with manual and delivery to the USA would cost 75+15+20+15=125 DEM
(Registration + manual + postage + Express).

You can send a cheque within Germany -- the preferred and safest
method. You can send cash too at your own risk. Inside Germany, the
registration can also be done via C.O.D. (for an extra 9.50 DEM -- this
includes the 3 DEM extra charged by the postman).

You can also send a cheque from outside of Germany, but please bear in
mind that this can present some difficulties and disproportionate costs
(an extra 20 DEM is not unusual). Please ensure that there is enough
money left over to pay your registration fee once all the additional
costs have been met, otherwise your registration cannot be processed!

Since foreign cheques are often troublesome (Eurocheques in DEM and
cheques from a German bank are fine, though), we prefer foreign
registrations to be paid with postal order or in cash (preferably DEM,
or US Dollars of equivalent value plus 10%).

Send your registration (in German, English or, if necessary, in French)
to:

Katrin Schmidt
Finkenweg 26
89233 Neu-Ulm
Deutschland

updates for MakeCD. Do not panic just yet. Read the next section!

To be able to use the internet updates, you have to send your address
to the authors of MakeCD. This can be done with the enclosed
registration card, or it can be done directly by your dealer. Shortly
after sending your address to the authors, you will receive your
registration key without further charge. This new key can also be used
with the Internet versions and updates. The only other difference is
that you are @{B}not@{UB} entitled to support directly from the authors.

@{B}Supported CD writers and CD-ROM drives
======================================@{UB}

If you would like to learn more about the support for various devices,
please read the compatibility list. The devices in the following list
are generally supported.

Please note that, unlike the makers of certain other CD writer
software, we have constructed this list with our own research. Similar
looking lists should be read with caution since some drives mentioned
later require special treatment in order to work with their
corresponding driver.

We own the following CD writers, which of course means that they are
particularly well supported:

   · Philips CDD 2600

   · Plextor PX-R412

   · Ricoh MP6200S

   · Yamaha CDR 100

   · Yamaha CDR 400t

We have had the use of the following writers for a lengthy period of
time in order to program the drivers. We have since returned these
drives to their respective owners:

   · JVC XR-W2010

   · Matsushita CW-7501

   · Mitsumi CR2801TE

   · Panasonic CW-7502

   · Philips CDD 2000

   · Plextor PX-R24CSi

   · Sony CDU 926S

   · Yamaha CDR 400c

The following CD writers are generally supported by MakeCD. CD writers
marked with "(*)" have not been tested by us, but in theory, they
should work too.

@{B}Diferences: CD Writers, CD-ROM Drives
=====================================@{UB}

CD writers usually resemble CD-ROM drives being equipped with either a
tray or caddy.

In general, CD writers can read CDs and CD-Rs as well as write CD-Rs.
CD-Rs can be thought of as CDs that can be written to. Since the
read/write head used in the CD writer is significantly heavier than
that of a conventional CD drive, it cannot move as quickly as its
CD-ROM drive counterpart. Subsequently, the average transfer rates and
seek rates tend to be slower than normal CD-ROM drives.

Nevertheless, CD writers can be used for reading CDs and CD-Rs. Just
like conventional CD-ROM drives, CD writers can be mounted via a CD
filesystem and then be used to access CDs on your Workbench screen. To
do so, just enter the device name (Device name, ie. `scsi.device') and
device number (unit number) of the CD writer instead of the CD-ROM
drive's values when you install the CD filesystem. Of course, you can
also modify a mountlist entry (or `DEVS:DOSDrivers/CD0') accordingly.

If you mount a CD filesystem on the CD writer while burning a CD-R,
please make sure that the filesystem does not attempt to access the CD
writer as this could cause problems such as a defective CD-R. While
MakeCD accesses your CD writer, it tries to recognize and lock all CD
filesystems that are mounted on your CD writer. This does not always
work due to technical reasons, so care is needed.

@{B}CD-Rs
=====@{UB}

CD-Rs look like CDs. CD-R is a medium that can be written to using a CD
writer. After the write process, CD-Rs may, in general, be used with
any CD player or CD-ROM drive.

In contrast to conventional silver CD-ROMs, CD-Rs are available in
green, gold or even blue.

Further distinctions between CD-ROMs and CD-Rs concern the CD-R's label
surface. Some have a big label surface, other only a small one.

If a written label is required, do not use pointed objects. Write only
onto the label. Damaging the label surface is likely to damage the data
layer situated immediately below, which often leads to an unreadable CD.

Take care when using additional labels. Labels attached to just one
side will almost certainly make the CD-R wobble inside the CD-ROM
drive. Some people find out the hard way that the removal of the label
can damage the golden colour (reflective layer) of the CD-R's surface.
Have fun with your `coaster'...

Avoid buying large quantities of CD-Rs until you are happy with the
performance of the brand. Some CD-Rs may be happy during the write
process only to later fail whenb used on other CD-ROM drives. Some
drives may read the CD-Rs flawlessly while others may take a very long
time to read the disc -- and even then there may be read errors.

In our experience Toshiba drives in particular may have problems
reading some CD-R brands. This does @{B}not@{UB} mean that there is a problem
with Toshiba drives! It simply means that you should try brands in
small quantities until you are happy with the results.

@Node "MIBUF" "MakeCD.guide/MIBUF"

@Toc "MINTR"

@{B}Buffering
=========@{UB}

Once a CD writer has started to write data, it must continue to write
@{B}uninterrupted@{UB} until all the data has been written. With
@{"Track-At-Once" Link "MITAO"} mode, the track that is being written must be finished.

In @{"Disc-At-Once" Link "MIDAO"} mode the entire CD must be written without interruption.

The CD writer writes the data to CD-R several times to allow possible
data recovery in the event of a defect. While writing block N, some
data of blocks N-1 and N+1 are incorporated into block N
@{B}simultaneously@{UB}. If the data of block N+1 does not exist, block
N cannot be written and so on.

Due to this, programs for CD writers and the CD writer itself require
adequate buffering to ensure the continuous flow of data. If the data
flow stops, the CD writer fails to plug the gap caused by the
interruption when the write process resumes. CD writers usually have
their own internal buffer of 512KB to 2MB. MakeCD uses its own buffer
to combat the possibility of the CD writer's buffer emptying due to a
shortage of new data.

If reselection for the CD writer is @{B}turned on@{UB}, the SCSI bus will be
blocked for a short time only while MakeCD sends data to the CD writer.
With reselection @{B}turned off@{UB}, the CD writer will block the SCSI bus most
of the time. Very little time remains to read new data from the same
SCSI bus.

As a result, MakeCD's internal buffer will always be close to empty
when you read data from the same bus with reselection @{B}turned off@{UB}. In
this instance, a large internal buffer for the CD writer is of great
help.

If you have to turn off reselection for your CD writer (in order to
avoid SCSI problems), try to read the data from @{B}another@{UB} SCSI bus or IDE
controller. Otherwise, MakeCD's buffer will be close to empty most of
the time, increasing the risk of a buffer underrun.

If you cannot use another SCSI interface or IDE controller for the
source, swallow the bitter pill and try the process with an almost
empty buffer. Turn off `Parallel Read/Write' in the settings. This will
improve the performance slightly. In all other cases, `Parallel
Read/Write' should be @{B}turned on@{UB}. As ever, we recommend that you test
your system extensively in the test mode!

@{B}Interesting facts about tracks and sessions
===========================================@{UB}

CDs and fixed CD-Rs contain one or more sessions. Each fixed session
has one or more tracks. A track @{B}cannot@{UB} extend across sections. Here's
an example:

     ---- Lead-In (Start of CD and 1st Session) ---- (1)
     ----                Track 1                ----
     ----                Track 2                ----
     ----                Track 3                ----
     ----    Lead-Out (End of 1st Session)     ----
     ----    Lead-In (Start of 2nd Session)     ---- (2)
     ----                Track 4                ----
     ----                Track 5                ----
     ----    Lead-Out (End of 2nd Session)     ----
     ----    Lead-In (Start of 3rd Session)     ---- (3)
     ----                Track 6                ----
     ----    Lead-Out (End of 3rd Session)     ----
     ----    Lead-In (Start of 4th Session)     ---- (4)
     ----                Track 7                ----
     ---- Lead-Out (End of CD and 4th Session) ----

Creating a new track requires a comparatively small capacity - about
300KB or 152 blocks plus the data for the new track (which must be at
least 600KB). In contrast, a new session takes up 22.5MB to fix the
first session and 13.5MB to fix all subsequent sessions, not forgetting
further memory for the actual data itself.

The more sessions a CD or CD-R incorporates the longer it takes for the
CD-ROM drive to read the table of contents (TOC). Given the example
above, the index of tracks 1 to 3 (track list) would be stored at (1),
the index of track 4 and 5 at (2), the index of track 6 at (3) and the
index of track 7 at (4). Therefore, the drive accesses four positions
on the CD/CD-R just to read the complete track list (TOC).

Old CD-ROM drives or CD players that do not support multisession will
be unaware of the additional tracks stored at position (2), and only
tracks 1 to 3 will be accessible.

While some CD writers are capable of displaying unfixed tracks in the
track list (TOC), others require special commands to access these
tracks.  CD-ROM file systems can only recognize such tracks if the CD-R
in a CD writer (not a CD-ROM drive) @{B}and@{UB} if the CD writer displays the
tracks in the track list. If required, MakeCD additionally reads the
PMA (a special area of a CD-R) to generate a complete track list.
CD-ROM file systems @{B}cannot@{UB} offer you this feature.

Read errors may occur when searching through sessions, resulting in
some tracks not being displayed. This is more likely to happen with
CD-Rs that contain many sessions. Reinserting the CD-R usually
alleviates the problem.

CD writers can read tracks that are in unfixed sessions. However, most
CD-ROM drives cannot see such tracks. The result is that most CD-ROM
drives will only read your CD-R if it is fixed. If the CD-R is not
fixed, only those tracks leading up to the last fixed track will be
shown.

If you would like to use the CD-R in your CD writer only and provided
that your CD writer shows unfixed tracks in the TOC, you do not have to
fix the CD (fixing takes up lots of space!). You can burn the tracks to
the CD bit by bit (including data tracks), then fix the CD or session
at the very end of the process. You can also create multisession CDs in
this way -- i.e. without fixing the CD, although the name
"Multisession" is no longer the correct description. However, the
functionality is the same as a multisession CD.

@{B}Fix Session Or CD-R
===================@{UB}

Users are often confused as to whether they should fix the session or
the CD-R. The following section aims to clarify the difference!:

   · If you fix the CD-R, you cannot write any more data to the CD-R!
     The CD-R can then only be read. Do not fix the CD-R is you want to
     write more tracks to the CD-R at a later date!

   · If you fix the session, a new session is automatically opened.
     You will then be able to read all the tracks in the fixed sessions
     in a CD-ROM drive.

   · If you have not fixed the CD-R and if you have not fixed the
     session, you @{B}cannot@{UB} usually read that is contained in the unfixed
     session using a CD-ROM drive. You can still read these tracks in
     the CD writer. If you are not bothered about reading the CD-R in a
     standard CD-ROM drive, you may prefer not to fix the session and
     use the space for more data!

   · Sessions and indeed the CD-R can only be fixed if there is at
     least one track in the last session. Empty sessions cannot be
     fixed in either case.

   · If you have fixed a session, you can no longer fix the CD-R
     without further changes, since a new session is automatically
     opened and you cannot fix an empty session! Incidentally, fixing a
     CD-R is in principle identical to fixing a session, with the
     exception that a new session is @{B}not@{UB} opened when you fix the CD-R
     and subsequently the CD-R cannot be written to again.

   · You should fix the CD-R if you are certain that no more data (now
     or later) will be written to the CD-R. This is because some drives
     take much longer to read a CD in which only the sessions are
     fixed. In this case, drives waste time looking in vain for data in
     the last open session, hitting upon read errors (because there is
     no data there!).

@{B}What Happens During Test Mode
=============================@{UB}

There is a gadget both in the preferences and the writing window that
lets you turn test mode on or off. But what happens during test mode?

With test mode activated, the CD writer will pretend to write rather
than write for real.

MakeCD sends data to the writer just as it would if writing for real.
The writer performs almost identical actions, with the exception that
the laser is not activated and thus the CD-R is not written to!

Since the actions carried out in test mode are so similar to those when
writing for real, test mode is an invaluable tool to establish if there
are any problems with the SCSI bus, or if there are buffering/transfer
speed problems (i.e. you can test for buffer underruns and overflows).

Most CD writers remember any tracks that you write in test mode. These
"virtual" tracks will be displayed in the target CD-R window track list
even though they do not exist! This is not a problem, since you can
remove these tracks if necessary. Simply remember that you may need to
make your CD writer forget these tracks when you construct a new track
list (click on Update).

We strongly advise all users of MakeCD to run the test mode before
burning for real. The test is all the more essential if the directories
you are copying contain many small files, or if you are using a slow
source, of if you are burning direct from CD-ROM drive to CD writer
(i.e. if you are not using image files).

@{B}How Multisession Works
======================@{UB}

What is multisession?

A data CD is a normal CD when you have written just one track to it.
Later on, you may wish to add more data. This is where multisession
comes in, letting you incorporate an  @{B}older@{UB} track into the new track.

MakeCD reads and remembers the contents of the last data track. The
position where the data is stored on the CD-R is also remembered. The
program then reads all information about the new data from hard disk
except the actual contents of those files. The table of contents
written into the new track contains information about the data of the
old track as well as the new data. Since the data proper of the first
track is already stored on the CD-R, all that is required in the new
track is a compact reference to the previous track. The data for the
new track is then written from the hard disk to the CD-R.

If you have already burnt two tracks and the second track incorporates
the reference data for the first track, the third track need only
incorporate a reference to the second track. Had you forgotten to
incorporate the reference for the first track when writing the second
track, simply record references for both the first and second track
when you write the third tack. Then, when you write the fourth track,
you need only incorporate a reference to the third track! Clever stuff!

How does this work in practice?

MakeCD offers a very flexible way of creating multisession CDs. You
select the tracks to be incorporated into an already existing track via
the `ISO settings window'. That is the same window that lets you select
directories to be included in the image file. In the case of identical
file names, the file of the track or directory scanned first will be
selected and all other identical file names will be ignored.

You may write to the CD-R as usual once you have selected the tracks
and directories. It's as simple as that!

MakeCD Version 2.1 upwards supports multisession data CDs.

@{B}Multivolume CDs
===============@{UB}

It is possible to burn several data tracks to a CD which will be shown
as a single data carrier by the file system. The file sytem must
support multivolume. Simply write the tracks one after the other and
then fix as soon as you want the tracks written to be readable in a
conventional CD-ROM drive.

For example, if you wish to write three tracks at the same time and
then read all three tracks in a CD-ROM drive, fix the session (or CD-R)
once all three tracks have been written. If you wish to write the
tracks at different times and you would like to access the CD-R in a
CD-ROM drive in between writing the tracks, you must fix the session
before you read the CD-R in the CD-ROM drive, regardless of whether you
have written one or several tracks in the session.

With a multivolume CD, each track represents an independent data
carrier -- the effect is similar to dividing a hard drive into
partitions.  See @{"Fixing" Link "MISCF"}.

The sole difference between multisession and multivolume is that tracks
of multivolume CD-Rs cannot contain data from previous tracks. If
multisession were implemented on a hard drive, the structure would be
as follows: the first partition would be a conventional one, the second
would hold new data and links to all data on the first partition and
the third partition would contain new data and links to all data on the
second partition, and so on. Implementing multisession on hard disks
would be rather confusing/useless. In contrast, multisession makes
sense with CD-Rs, especially since multivolume filesystems are rarely
used.

A CD-ROM file system that supports multivolume would either display all
the data tracks (relating this to hard drives: all partitions) or at
least permit you to select the track (relating this to hard drives: the
partition) that it should display.

MakeCD Version 2.0 upwards supports Multivolume CDs. Proceed as
described above. You will require a CD-ROM file system that supports
multivolume, e.g. CacheCDFS from the IDEfix '97 package.

@{B}CD-Extra: Audio And Data On One CD
==================================@{UB}

CD-Extra enables you to create mixed CDs (data and audio) which behave
like a standard music CD when used in a CD player. You must however
jump over the data track (you could damage your audio system by trying
to play a data track!). If the mixed CD is inserted in a CD-ROM drive,
the data track can be accessed!

First you burn all the audio tracks, then fix the session. This will
enable a CD player to recognize the disc as a standard audio CD. In the
next session you write a data track. A file system that supports
multisession will recognise the data track and allow you to access the
data contained within the track.

MakeCD supports the creation of CD-Extra from version 2.0 upwards.
Proceed as described above.

Create a list of tracks. Begin with the data track (this must be the
first track in the list), then add as many audio tracks you like. Once
you have completed the track list, write the CD-R.

Any CD-ROM drive can read the data track -- the drive does not have to
support multisession.

When the mixed mode CD is used with a CD player, skip the first track
since it is a data track. Take extreme care not to play the first track
of a Mixed Mode CD or CD-R -- this may damage your hi-fi equipment if
your CD player is not equipped to deal with a non-audio track.

@{B}Background details on ISO 9660
==============================@{UB}

ISO 9660 is a very old file system that was developed to allow almost
any computer system to access CDs.

Filenames can consist of capitals A-Z, numerals 0-9 and the underscore
character `_' only. Courtesy of MS-DOS ;-)

ISO Level 1 is additionally restricted to the 8+3 standard. File names
must not exceed eight characters in front of and three characters
behind the dot. The dot must be present and at least one character,
either before or behind the dot is required.

ISO level 2 is more flexible - it allows up to 31 characters including
the dot. Aside from the increased filename length, the same
restrictions with level 1 apply: file names must contain one and only
one dot and dots cannot be used for directory names.  Lower-case
characters and foreign characters are still not permitted.

These restrictions are not particularly suited to the AMIGA, since a
file with an icon cannot be supported under these conditions! The file
would lack the dot required. And if you did add the dot to the
filename, the icon would have two dots courtesy of the `.info'. This is
no good either, since two dots are not permitted for a filename!

As a result, it has become common practice within the AMIGA community
to discard the restrictions and instead use AMIGA filenames as they
stand. Thus, MakeCD offers a feature called the `ISO 9660 AMIGA'. If
selected, MakeCD uses the filenames as they are stored on your hard
drive.

ISO 9660 has a further restriction: There may be no more than eight
directory levels. MakeCD ignores this rule and writes as many levels as
you have selected. AMIGA filesystems can handle more than eight levels,
but an option to automatically move levels beyond a certain depth to
the limit is planned.

@{B}Rock Ridge and AMIGA Attributes
===============================@{UB}

Even Unix users were not content with the restrictions in ISO 9660.
They created an extension for this standard: Rock Ridge.

If a CD has Rock Ridge extensions, it has been created with ISO 9660,
but space reserved by ISO 9660 for extensions is used for the Rock
Ridge extensions.

File systems that recognize ISO 9660 only will not see the Rock Ridge
extensions, i.e. Rock Ridge extensions are not an obstacle even if the
system reading the disc does not support Rock Ridge!

The exact amount of additional space that Rock Ridge consumes on the CD
is hard to tell. Very roughly, about 50 to 150 extra bites are required
per directory or file, i.e. very little space is required.

Why use Rock Ridge?

Rock Ridge allows AMIGA users to be ISO 9660 compatible, yet also offer
longer filenames with any character to users with a file system that
supports Rock Ridge.

A file system that supports Rock Ridge also supports ISO 9660
technically. However, it will use the Rock Ridge names if they are
present on the CD. If you have a file system that supports Rock Ridge
but you get the shortened ISO 9660 file names, you probably need to
adjust one or two settings within your file system.

If you still have problems reading the Rock Ridge file names with a
file system that supports Rock Ridge, perhaps it does not support Rock
Ridge 1.12 (if it is old, maybe it only supports Rock Ridge 1.09).
Check with the maker of your file system to see if there is an update.

In mid 1996 a new standard (based on Rock Ridge) was developed,
primarily by Angela Schmidt working closely with other AMIGA
programmers and the principal author of Rock Ridge. This standard has
been adopted by the AMIGA and is supported by major file systems
(AmiCDFS, AsimCDFS and CacheCDFS). This standard permits AMIGA
protection bits and file comments on CDs within the Rock Ridge
extensions.

If you wish to use these AMIGA attributes, you will need to save the
Rock Ridge extensions too.

At last one can properly back-up a hard drive to CD-R! The advantage is
that you no longer lose the AMIGA attributes!

@{B}TAO: Track-At-Once Essentials
=============================@{UB}

Most CD writers offer several modes of writing a CD-R. The most common
and important modes are TAO (track-at-once) and DAO (disc-at-once).

The easiest method (for the programmers) to implement is track-at-once.
The program sends the data track by track to the writer and the writer
takes care of the actual write process.

The disadvantage of TAO is the fact that most CD writers insert a pause
of approximately 2 seconds (152 blocks) between the tracks. This is at
its most annoying when you write a live concert to CD-R using more than
one track -- you end up with a pause between each tracks.

DAO, with its own new restrictions, provides a solution to this.
MakeCD optionally supports DAO from version 3.0. You will need to be
registered for the DAO version. If you are registered for TAO only, you
cannot use this feature!

With track-at-once mode, you cannot avoid having pauses between tracks.
With disc-at-once, all tracks can be written without inter-track
pauses. DAO even allows you to create index marks within tracks!

Generally, DAO does not allow you to write more than one session to a
CD. More recent CD writers combat this with SAO (Session-At-Once),
permitting you to write several sessions to a CD in DAO mode.

MakeCDVersion 3.0 upwards supports DAO for a number of CD writers. We

Please install MakeCD using the supplied installation program which is
based on "Installer" by AMIGA International. If you are using a
cover-mount version, the program may be ready to run and not require
installation, in which case you should ignore this section.

In general it should be possible to start MakeCD without installing.

You initiate the install process with a double-click on "Install".

The install program offers you a choice of languages. Click on your
preferred language. The installer will proceed using the chosen
language.

Simply follow the instructions. If you are unsure at any point, click
on "Help".

Towards the end of the installation process, you can select which
CD-ROM and CD burner drivers you would like to have installed. If you
are already certain of which drivers you need, copy only those drivers.
Otherwise, copy all the drivers and try them all to judge which one is
best for your drive.

See @{"Preferences" Link "MIS00"}.

Once the installation is complete, open the directory that MakeCD was
installed to and start MakeCD. The registration window will open, so
enter your registration number. If the registration number is
incorrectly entered, MakeCD remains locked. So watch capitals etc. If
you wish to permanently save these details, you need to type in your
complete address, then click on "Save". Otherwise, click on "Use".

Once you have started MakeCD you need to set the correct @{"Preferences" Link "MIS00"}

@{B}Reading drive
-------------@{UB}

If you wish to burn tracks from a CD to a CD-R without using a
temporary file, you naturally require a CD-ROM drive in addition to a
CD writer, since the data has to be read at the same time as it is
being written.

The device that you enter here is used whenever you read a track. You
can enter the same device under @{B}Writing drive@{UB}, i.e. your CD writer, but
in this case temporary files must be used (image files).

Click on the popup gadget. A device selection window appears. If you
have problems here, please see @{"FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)" Link "MF000"}.

The device selection window searches your system for device drivers
("Devices"). The majority of device drivers in your system are not
suitable for SCSI commands and hence are filtered out. Usually, very
few drivers remain, and even some of these may not necessarily
understand SCSI commands.

Chose the device driver for your SCSI card that the read drive is
connected to.

MakeCD then checks all the connected devices and displays them in the
unit list. Select the read drive from this list.

Some devices are automatically recognized by MakeCD and the appropriate
driver is set for you. Other devices are not recognized and are listed
as @{B}unknown@{UB}. Don't panic if this is the case, since one of the
MakeCD driver's will probably work. You can set the driver manually
with the `Driver' popup gadget.

If you have to set the driver manually, you should be aware that
MakeCD knows many SCSI commands for burning CDs, reading audio date,
etc. Each of these commands is saved in its own driver. Drivers that
begin with `CD_' (e. g. @{B}CD_@{UB}Plextor) are for CD-ROM drivers only.
Drivers that begin with @{B}CDR_@{UB} (e. g. @{B}CDR_@{UB}Sony) are suitable for CD
writers. `CD_ROM' is for CD-ROM drives, but will not read audio data.

In case you are not sure which driver you need, we recommend that you
try each driver until you find one that is suitable or exhaust all the
drivers. The latter should not happen if your drive is listed in the
MakeCD Compatibility List. The correct driver may even be suggested
there.

`CD_Plextor' and `CD_Sony' are almost identical. Both drivers are for
CD-ROM drives only. `CD_Plextor' additionally lets you set the read
speed for audio data. As such, `CD_Plextor' is usually the better
option.

If you wish for MakeCD to recognize your device automatically in
future, please send Patrick Ohly `patrick@core.de' the `INQUIRY' string
for your device (you will find this in the drive selection window). If
your device is currently unknown, it is because nobody had sent us this
information prior to the version of MakeCD that you are using.

Before you send us the data for your drives, you should carry out the
following tests to ensure that you have selected the best driver
(often, several drivers work for a particular CD writer).

   · Read Track Table of Contents (works with all drivers)

   · Read Data CDs (works with all drivers)

   · Read Audio CDs (does @{B}not@{UB} work with all drivers)

   · Set Speed for Reading Audio CDs (does @{B}not@{UB} work with all drivers)

When selecting the best driver, the compatibility list, shown in the
lower part of the device selection window, can be helpful. The list
will help you determine if the driver is for a CD-ROM drive of for a CD
writer, whether the drive speed can be set, and which format (Intel or
Motorola) the CDDA data is sent as and much more.

With on-the-fly copying, this means that the write speed may need to be

@{B}Buffers...
----------@{UB}

MakeCD uses internal buffers when burning CDs, creating image files or
playing audio data. You can set the size of each buffer and the size of
the chunks. If the Buffer size is not a multiple of the chunk size,
MakeCD automatically adjusts this for you.

@{B}Write tracks/CDs
................@{UB}

This is used for setting the buffer and Chunk size (in KB) used when
writing CDs.

Buffer Size
     In theory, setting "Buffer Size" to a higher value is not harmful.
     Should you enter a value that exceeds the available memory,
     MakeCD automatically uses a smaller buffer.

     If Reselection (Disconnect/Reselect) is @{B}turned off@{UB} and the data is
     being sent by a device that is connected to the @{B}same@{UB} SCSI-Bus, you
     can use a relatively small value for the buffer (e. g. 1000-2000
     KB). Since Reselection has been turned off, the buffer will remain
     close to empty anyway. You can also set a low value if you have
     turned on `Parallel read/write'

     If you have @{B}turned on@{UB} reselection for the CD writer, or if you are
     reading the data from a drive that is not connected in the same
     SCSI bus, set this value as high as possible. This will reduce the
     danger of a buffer underrun.

     You can read more about reselection under @{"SCSI Problems" Link "MFH00"}  and
     @{"Buffer Behaviour" Link "MIBUF"}.

     A sensible value for this field is 8000. However, a value between
     4000 and 20000 should be fine. Ultimately, you need to check the
     buffer level during writing to determine if the Buffer size is
     suitable.

Chunk size
     This field enables you to set the size of the data packets
     (chunks) that MakeCD sends to your CD writer. This value should
     @{B}not@{UB} exceed half the size of the internal buffer of your
     CD writer. In other words, at least two chunks should fit in the
     internal buffer of your CD writer, otherwise there is an acute
     danger of a buffer underrun.

     Some SCSI interfaces are uncomfortable with large chunk sizes.
     Therefore, a chunk size of 50 KB is suitable for your test. Later
     on, you can try increasing this value.

     If you had to turn off reselection and the writer is on the same
     SCSI bus as the reading drive, we recommend a @{B}small@{UB} chunk size.

@{B}Play audio data
...............@{UB}

Here you set the buffer size and chunk size for playing audio data in
KB.

Buffer size
     The smaller the "buffer" is, the quicker MakeCD starts playing
     audio data. However, if the buffer is too small, errors can arise.

Chunk size
     The "Chunk size" defines the size of the data packets used by
     MakeCD to send data to the `audio.device' or `ahi.device'. The
     larger the chunk size that you set here, the longer it takes on
     average until an action like a change in volume comes into effect.
     If the chunk sizes are too small, the audio may suffer.

We recommend a chunk size between 20 to 50 KB and at least double that
value for the buffer size.

@{B}Create image files
..................@{UB}

This is the place where you set the buffer size and chunk size for
creating image files. Usually, the "Buffer size" can be set to a small
value (about 1 MB), and the "Chunk size" can usually be set to a value
similar to the one you are using to write tracks/CDs.

The buffer size and chunk size are also used for creating audio images.
With some drives, you should avoid too small a buffer for reading audio
data. Keep an eye on the Write Window. If the buffer reaches the right
boundary, your drive may possibly chop off some of the audio data
during a buffer overflow.

So, if your drive sends data at a faster rate than the buffer (to the
hard drive), the MakeCD buffer fills up. On the next attempt by your
drive to send data, it must wait -- with some drives, this can lead to
crackling/noise. If this happens with your drive, ensure that the
buffer is large enough and/or that your drive is reading the data at a
slow enough rate to avoid a buffer overflow.

If you are creating an ISO image on your hard drive, there is no need
for a large buffer since buffer underruns or overflows will not occur.

@{B}Audio reading - fill buffer completely
......................................@{UB}

With some drives, if the software does not immediately take the audio
data when the drive stops reading, the CD-ROM drive may produce noise.

MakeCD is unable to accept the audio data immediately when the buffer
is @{B}full@{UB}. MakeCD must wait until there is enough free space in the
buffer for a complete chunk of data.

So that MakeCD works as harmoniously as possible with such drives,
MakeCD usually only half-fills the buffer when reading audio data befre
sending it to the writer. Then the data arriving from the CD-ROM drive
can continue to be accepted unhindered. Since the buffer is only
half-filled, this increases the risk of a buffer underrun for the
On-the-fly burning of audio tracks.

If the drive still transfers audio data error-free when the buffer is
full, you should turn on this option. If the data is poor or the drive
reports errors when the buffer is full, this option must be turned off.

Some CD-ROM drivers or burners will report an error if they are reading

internal RAM fills and the read process must be interrupted.

When audio reading is interrupted with some drives, the drive can
continue reading from the wrong position. Some drives will warn you
about this by reporting an error. You can ignore such errors by turning
on the `Ignore overflow' option.

If your drive does not report these errors, do not select this option.
This is because the drive may be reporting a more serious error that
you should be aware of. Should your drive continuously report errors,
try reducing the read speed. You should also increase the buffer size.
If you still have problems, consider using another drive.

It is unfortunately not standard practice to save raw audio data (CDDA
data) in files. Some programs save them in Motorola Format (MSB),
others in Intel Format (LSB).

This field lets you chose the format that MakeCD should use to read raw
audio date from @{B}files@{UB} to write to @{B}files@{UB}. MakeCD will know which format
to use when reading music data from a CD or when burning it to a CD-R.

For example, if you get CDDA files from a friend that are in Intel
Format and you want to write these files to a CD-R using MakeCD, enter
`Intel' here. MakeCD will then know that the data is in Intel format.
Even if your CD writer requires the data in Motorola format, MakeCD
will automatically convert the data on-the-fly during the burn process.

If, on the other hand, your friend wants the data in Motorola format,
enter `Motorola'. MakeCD will automatically convert into Motorola
format on-the-fly.

If you are working exclusively with MakeCD and you have no need to
create CDDA files for other programs, you can more or less set this
gadget how you like -- it will not affect the functionality. That said,
most CD writers and readers use the Intel format, so you can often save
a little time if you set the gadget to `Intel'.

You can determine the format that your writer or reader uses by looking
at the display in the Device Selection Window.

@{B}Audio length
............@{UB}

MakeCD attempts to automatically determine if the files to burn are of
the correct type. For CDDA files, it is impossible to determine if they
are CDDA files or some other data type. MakeCD checks to see if the
size of the file to burn is a multiple of 2352 bytes, since CDDA files
which have been read from CD always have a length that is a multiple of
2352 bytes.

All very well, but if you have sampled the data yourself, it is
unlikely to have a length that is a multiple of 2352 bytes, so
MakeCD cannot tell if the data is CDDA. In this case, you need to tell
MakeCD not to be so fussy about the file size when checking for CDDA
files.

Select `Block' if you are reading audio data from CD only. If you are
sampling audio data yourself, you must select `any'.

If you select `any', MakeCD will no longer carry out the CDDA test. It
is therefore no longer possible to warn that the data is not in CDDA
format. If you are not careful, you may accidentally burn data a file
as CDDA -- a loud rustle.

@{B}Audio pause
...........@{UB}

There is unfortunately no standard method to determine the exact length
of the track. Most programs work on the assumption that the audio track
ends where the next track begins.

This assumption can lead to reading the pause between tracks (if there
is a pause between tracks). The result is frequently two seconds of
total silence at the end of a section of music.

This field lets you set the pause size after audio tracks. MakeCD will
cut the corresponding number of blocks from the track. This can enable
you to completely remove the two second pause at the end of a track --
at least in the image file. With Track-At-Once mode, the two second
pause (152 blocks) is added again to each audio track.

CDs that you wish to write in TAO mode generally have a pause of 152
blocks between the tracks (this corresponds to 2 2/75 seconds). So, the
best value to enter here is usually 152 or 00:02;2 See @{"Track-At-Once" Link "MITAO"}.

@{B}Note:@{UB} If you change this setting having already selected the tracks in
the Track Selection Window, you must remove the tracks then reselect
them.

This setting works @{B}exclusively@{UB} when selecting the audio tracks that are

Rather than write to an image file, you can write data directly to a
block medium (e.g. directly to the hard drive). This can be useful if
you mount a hard drive then a CD-ROM file system in order to test the
data. In addition, you can -- if you don't have a CD writer -- send the
data in this form (directly on the hard drive) to a CD company.

If you select an area of the hard drive which is used by a file system,
the file system will be overwritten during the process, losing
important data -- only in rare cases can this data be recovered!

If, in spite of our warning, you still want to enter a value, click on
the popup gadget. A device selection window will open.

The device needn't support SCSI commands, but it must support
Trackdisk-compatible commands. Select the device you require.

You then need to enter which blocks can be overwritten on this device.
Normally you would enter a startblock of 0 and a high number as the end
block. MakeCD will only overwrite blocks within this region. Note that
the Rigid Disk Block is usually saved to block 0 on the `AMIGA'. If you
destroy the RDB, maybe RDB-Salv can help...

The value that you enter here will only be used if you set `Block
medium' to either `Source' or `Target'

If you are using a hard drive (preferably empty)and if you have
correctly set the values, close the window with `OK'.

     a data or audio track, although other settings are possible.
     Proceed as described in @{"Advanced Options" Link "MITTO"}. This describes how to
     set the pause and the ISRC.

  4. If you want to burn an audio track, set index marks as described
     in @{"Indices" Link "MITTI"}.


Carry out all these steps for each track that you wish to create. Some
steps can be omitted according to your needs -- MakeCD makes some of
the settings for you. Once you have finished, you can burn the CD-R or
create the image files.

The correct source for each track must be entered in the Track Options
Window. The source is the data source that should be used for the track
concerned. The following settings are available:

File System
     The data for the track is read from a hard drive or another medium
     and an ISO 9660 image is created so that the data can be read on
     the CD.

Track from CD
     You can read the data for the new track from another CD. This can
     be any type of track. The track is then copied to the CD-R.

@{B}     If you do not select this setting, you need to select the source
     track. Click on the popup gadget for the source and select the
     track from the Track Input Window that appears.@{UB}

Image File
     This preference has MakeCD read the data from an image file that
     you have created on a hard drive. This could be an ISO image,
     audio data, or another format.

@{B}     If you select this setting, you need to choose the image file that
     you want to burn to the CD. Click on the popup gadget and select
     the image file using the file selection window.@{UB}

     Once you have selected an image file, MakeCD shows you the data
     type that it recognizes or guesses. The following types are
     possible:

    [AIFF]:
          An AIFF file which is automatically converted by MakeCD
          before it is sent to the writer. The conversion is so rapid
          that an intermediate file is not usually required.

    [AIFC]:
          A file in AIFC-Format which MakeCD converts automatically
          before passing it on to the burner. Only uncompressed files
          are accepted.

    [CDDA?]:
          CDDA files cannot be recognized with certainty. CDDA data can
          be in one of two formats: `MSF' or `Motorola' and `LSF' or
          `Intel'. You need to check that you have entered the correct
          format for your drive in the settings under `Raw audio data'.

    [DATA?]:
          Data tracks cannot be identified unambiguously, hence the
          question mark.

    [HDP]:
          A file of the format "Samplitude Hard Disk Project" that is
          converted automatically by MakeCD before it is passed on to
          the burner. Note that MakeCD does not check the frequency of
          the project but assumes that it was created at 44.1 kHz. If
          you try to burn a project that has a different frequency, the
          disc will produce distortions when played!

    [IFF]:
          A file in a recognized IFF format that is not supported by
          MakeCD.

    [MAUD]:
          A file in MAUD format. This file is converted automatically
          by MakeCD before it is sent to the burner. The u-law and
          a-law compression types are supported.

    [MPEG-A]:
          A file in MPEG-A format which is converted automatically by
          MakeCD before it is passed on to the burner. Note that
          Stephane Tavenard's mpega.library must be installed. You
          should also note that not all systems are fast enough to burn
          such files on-the-fly. In case of doubt use an image file
          otherwise a buffer under-run may damage the CD-R.

    [WAV]:
          A file in WAV format which is converted automatically by
          MakeCD before it is sent on to the burner. The file must be
          uncompressed.

    [8SVX]:
          A file in IFF-8SUX format. This format is not supported by
          MakeCD.

    [<Track Type>]:
          If a track type is shown within the square brackets,
          MakeCD has recognized data it wrote previously. MakeCD knows
          that it must be burnt as declared in the track type.

    [???]:
          MakeCD is unable to ascertain or even guess the type of file
          concerned. Choose a different image file or change the `Track
          type'.

     The audio files usually need to be uncompressed. The audio data
     must be burnt with a frequency of 44.1 kHZ, hence you should
     ensure that your files are at this frequency. MakeCD will convert
     automatically if required, but the conversion takes up much
     processor time. The implication is that it may be necessary to
     work with an image file to avoid a buffer under-run.

Block medium
     This setting reads the data from the block medium defined in the
     MakeCD @{"Settings" Link "MIS00"} This option is normally only used when you have
     created an image on this block medium and would like the image to
     be written to CD-R.

@{B}     If you choose this setting, all that remains is to check that you
     have set the correct block medium in the Settings Window.@{UB}

@{B}Target
......@{UB}

Target sets whether data should be sent directly to the CD writer or to
an image file. In addition, you are able to set the name of the image
file and when (if at all) the image file should be automatically
deleted by MakeCD.

The cycle gadget for `Target' has the follow options:

Use image file
     The data is not sent directly to the CD writer. Instead, an image
     file is created. The data can only be sent to the writer once it
     has been written to the image file.

@{B}     You should use this option if your hard drive has sufficient free
     storage space and you are not sure if the source can send the data
     at a fast enough rate.@{UB}

@{B}     Do not forget to enter the image file that is to be created under
     `Image file'. Old files with the same name are overwritten if the
     length of the image file is not the same size as the data to be
     written. Otherwise, the image files that already exist are used.@{UB}

     Audio data is written according to the name you have entered for
     the image file. `.aiff' and `.aif' creates a file in AIFF format,
     `aifc' and `afc' a file in AIFC format, `.maud' a file in MAUD
     format and `.wav' or `.wave' a file in WAVE format. Other endings
     create a file in raw CDDA format. The audio data is always written
     as 16-bit stereo at 44.1 kHz.

     If you would like to burn using an image file, use the `Delete
     file' to determine if and when the image file should be deleted.
     MakeCD will only delete the files automatically if they were
     created using the `Write Tracks...' function.

    Immediately
          The image file is created before the track is written, then
          it is deleted as soon as the track has been written. Use this
          option if you do not have room for all the image files on
          your hard drive.

          With Disc-At-Once mode, the CD-R must be written in one go.
          This means that -- in contrast to Track-At-Once mode -- it is
          not possible to delete each image file in between writing
          tracks. This means that, in DAO mode, you need enough hard
          drive storage space for @{B}all@{UB} the image files.

    After CD
          The image file is created before the first track is written
          and deleted when you quit the Write Window. Use this option
          when you want to write the same CD a number of times or when
          the source and target drive is the same device.

    Never
          The image file is created before the first track is written
          and it is not automatically deleted. This option is useful if
          you want to burn the same CD another time.

Direct to CD writer
     The data is sent directly to the CD burner. An image file is @{B}not@{UB}
     created; a block medium is not used.

     It is often possible to transfer the data directly to the burner.
     However, be sure to try the test mode first. If test mode fails,
     perhaps you should use an image file after all.

Use block medium
     MakeCD can write data directly to the hard drive -- starting at a
     block you have entered (usually block 0). This can be extremely
     useful if you want to test the ISO image before burning it. Also,
     most CD manufacturers can accept this form as source.

@{B}     This option uses the block medium that is defined in the@{UB}
     @{"Settings Window" Link "MIS00"} @{B}The image will be created on this medium.@{UB}

@{B}Advanced Options
................@{UB}

With `Advanced Options' you can set some more track-specific options,
the most important of which is `Track type'. Use the cycle gadget to
set the track type. The following settings are available:

Data (Mode 1)
     You must use this track type if you want to create a data track.
     You use data tracks for writing the contents of your hard drive to
     CD-ROM. 2048 bytes per block are burnt.

Audio (normal)
     You need this type for burning a conventional audio track, for
     example, if you want to create a music CD. 2352 bytes are used per
     block.

Audio (Preemphasize)
     You rarely require this track type. However, there is a type of
     audio data that differs from standard audio data. CD players can
     use this data to attain a higher quality. MakeCD will not use this
     setting for playing the data (it is played as normal audio data).
     If you burn a track with this type, 2352 bytes per block are used.

Mode 2 Form 1
     This track type is used for normal data on CD-ROM/XA-CDs. This
     mode is similar to `Datatrack (Mode 1)'. 2048 bytes are used for
     each block.

Mode 2 Form 2
     This mode is suitable if error correction is not required (e.g.
     with audio or video data). 2328 bytes are used per block.

Mode 2
     This enables you to mix mode 1 and mode 2 blocks. A sub-header in
     each block indicates which form (1 or 2) the block was created
     with -- if the block has a particular form. The sub-header can be
     omitted, leaving 2336 usable bytes per block. This mode is rarely
     used.

The source must transfer data in the correct form, which you define in
`Track type'. MakeCD often recognizes the required track type itself,
in which case it will set the type for you.

Under `Pause' you enter how much @{B}longer@{UB} the pause between tracks should
be on top of the technical minimum. Note that in some cases the pause
length cannot be changed -- such as with Track-At-Once mode. If you
want to create an audio CD without pauses between tracks, you need to
use the @{B}Disc-At-Once@{UB} version of MakeCD. Even with DAO, there will be a
small pause between a data and an audio track.

`ISRC' (International Standard Recording Code) identifies audio tracks.
It consists (in this order) of a country code, an owner code, the year
of recording and a serial number. These fields are often left blank.

@{B}Indices
.......@{UB}

You can set indices within the track markings for audio CDs, which you
can then use for targetted jumping with some quality CD players. If you
write in Disk-At-Once mode (some writers support this feature with TAO
mode too), you can set these markings when the music is played by
MakeCD, or you can manually enter it in the list in the Track Options
Window. There are always two indices: one at the start of the song and
another in the first block of the pause after the track. It is possible
to add up to another 98 indices in between.

You can add new indices using `New' in the Index List. You can remove
indices from the list with "Remove". The position of an index is
changed using "Index Entry Field".  "Read from Source" causes
MakeCD to read the indices from the source and automatically enter them
in the list.

`Base Dir' defines the directory where the image files are created.
Simply enter the directory.

This is particularly useful if you want the image files for each CD to
use their own directory. If you specify this path before you create the
track list, selecting the filenames for the image files is much quicker.

This option is particularly usefuls for CDs containing many tracks,
e.g. music CDs.

@Node "MITFS" "MakeCD.guide/MITFS"

@Toc "MIF00"

@{B}Start block
...........@{UB}

In most instances, `Start block' does not have to be selected. It is
only required when you need to create image files for
Mutlisession/Multivolume CDs. In needs be, MakeCD makes an enquiry
before creating the image file in order to calculate the start block
automatically.

`Start block' is the block on the CD-R that should be written next. For
an empty CD, this value is 0. If the CD already contains data, it is a
positive value. Set the track type for the first track, insert the CD-R
in the writer and activate the popup gadget -- MakeCD will determine
the next block that can be written (i.e. the start block). The track
type of the first track to be written must be correctly set first
because the start block of the track type can depend on the track type
of the first track.

Actually, `Startblock' need only be filled in correctly if you want to
create an image file for a CD-R which already contains data and if you
do not have this CD-R at hand or if you do not have a CD-burner at
hand. The value that you enter under `Start block' is only used by
MakeCD if you click on @{B}Create image file(s)@{UB} and not if you want the
image files created automatically via `Write tracks'.

If you have the target CD-R and CD-ROM drive (but no burner),
MakeCD can use the CD-ROM drive to calculate the start block if the
session was fixed after the last track on the CD-R. Otherwise the
CD-ROM drive will an incorrect value.

Wenn Ihr Freund die CD-R, zu der Sie Daten hinzufügen wollen, gerade
besitzt, können Sie ihn anrufen und bitten, Ihnen den korrekten
Startblock mitzuteilen. Dann können Sie sogar ein Multivolume-Image
erzeugen, ohne die CD-R wirklich in den Händen zu halten.

Note that MakeCD automatically uses the correct start block if the CD-R
is available and you click on `Write tracks'. In this case, the start
block entered by the user is ignored.

When you call `Create image files', the value entered for `Start block'
is used or the user is asked which CD-R the image is intended for.

MakeCD will warn you should you try creating an image file with the
wrong start block. So long as you do not ignore the warning, you have
little to fear!

@{B}Catalog Number
..............@{UB}

You can enter a `catalog number' with 13 digits to identify the entire
CD in accordance with the UPC/EAN codes.

Some CD writers let you set the catalog number in Track-At-Once mode,
but other drives permit this only in the Disc-At-Once mode. Check the
Device Selection Window (the window in which you choose the settings
for your CD writer) to see if your drive can set the catalog number in
TAO mode too.

@Node "MITFW" "MakeCD.guide/MITFW"

@Toc "MIF00"

@{B}Write Mode
..........@{UB}

`Write Mode' determines whether the CD is written in `Disc-At-Once' or
`Track-At-Once' mode. If your writer also supports `Session-At-Once'
and you would like to burn in this mode, set `Write mode' to
`Disc-At-Once'. Then, set `Fixation' to `Session'. Please note that you
can only burn properly in DAO mode if you have either registered as a
private user of DAO, or if you have chosen one of the higher
registration classes.

Track-At-Once
     Each track is written separately. The data stream can be removed
     between writing the tracks. The CD can even be removed from the
     drive. In other words, the CD can be burnt in several sittings.

     If the datastream is interrupted during burning, only the last
     track written is affected. You can fix the CD or carry on writing
     to it.

     If you are using Track-At-Once, MakeCD can create image files
     separately, creating then deleting the file before the next image
     is required. This means that only one image file will be on the
     hard drive at a time, vastly reducing the storage space required.
     For this mode, set `Delete file' (in the Track Options Window) to
     `Immediately'. Then, click on `Write tracks...'. MakeCD will take
     care of the rest for you.

Disc-At-Once
(Also Burns Session-At-Once)
     You must be registered for Disk-At-Once if you want to burn
     properly with Disc-At-Once. An additional fee is required for
     owners of the private user version. If you are not registered for
     Disc-At-Once you can try it out in test mode.

     Please note that DAO only works if it is supported by the driver
     that you use for your CD writer. Not all of the MakeCD drivers
     support DAO. If you select your driver in the Device Selection
     Window, a separate region shows the features of the selected
     driver.

     Even if your MakeCD driver supports DAO, your writer may or may
     not support DAO. Sony drives in particular may no longer support
     DAO. Come to your own conclusions as to why!

     With DAO, the entire CD is burnt in one go. This enables you to
     avoid pauses between two audio tracks. The CD must be empty prior
     to burning, and the CD will be fixed at the end of the of the
     process. Some CD writers additionally support `Session-At-Once'.
     This mode requires an empty session. After burning, only the
     session is fixed, not the entire CD-R. Please note that not all CD
     writers support this mode.

     Disc-At-Once or Session-At-Once mode lends MakeCD more control in
     terms of where tracks start and how the data is written within the
     track. This enables a more precise copying of a CD than is
     possible in Track-At-Once mode.

@Node "MITFD" "MakeCD.guide/MITFD"

@{B}Data Format
...........@{UB}

The `Data Format' setting only refers to burning in Disc-At-Once mode.
If you are using DAO, this determines the format in which MakeCD sends
data to the burner or the format for the image files.

Some CD writers support only one of the two formats. If this is the
case, the setting will be ignored on burning. Image files, on the other
hand, will be created with the selected format.

If you wish to know which formats your CD writer (or the MakeCD driver
for your CD writer), go to the Settings window and open the Device
Selection Window for your drive. You will find details there about the
driver's features.

You can use `Data Format' to set the following options:

Format of the Writer
     This is the default setting. MakeCD will use the format that your
     CD writer supports, usually `Cooked User Data'. If the writer does
     not support this, `Raw Block Contents' is used.

     If you are unfamiliar with DAO, use this setting to ensure good
     results.

Raw Block Contents
     This transfers each block including the management, checksum and
     error correction data. For example, a data block will transfer
     2352 bytes instead of just 2048 bytes. If you would like the
     copied CD to be as identical as possible to the source CD, use
     this mode -- the management data will then be copied from the
     source CD rather than be recalculated.

     If you attempt to create a data CD in DAO mode and you have
     selected `Raw Block Contents', MakeCD then has to calculate the
     check sums and error corrections itself. The time needed for these
     calculations is very considerable, so we thoroughly recommend that
     you try the test mode first to avoid a buffer under-run and faulty
     CD. Reduce the speed down to single if necessary or use an image
     file for the affected tracks.

@{B}Type
----@{UB}

Use the `Type' gadget to specify the type for each source in the source:

File System
     Data is to be taken from the hard drive (either a directory
     including all subdirectories and files, or a single file) and
     recorded into an ISO image.

     If you set a source as type `File system', you must enter a file
     or directory in the text gadget below. You can alternatively
     select the file or directory using the file selection window.

     Only the @{B}content@{UB} of the directory (or file) that you have selected
     will be recorded into the ISO image. The structure @{B}within@{UB} a
     directory is preserved, but the path @{B}in front@{UB} of the directory (or
     file) is not preserved.

CD-R Track
     Use the popup gadget to select the track that you wish to record
     into the ISO image. You can record more than one track from the
     same CD into the ISO image.

     Please note that the sequence of the sources is important. If
     files from the hard drive should have precedence over files with
     the same name that have already been burned, cite the CD-R track
     @{B}after@{UB} the files from the hard drive.

     For example, if you burn a data CD in four sessions and you would
     like to have access to all the data in each session, when you
     create a new ISO image, simply record the last track that was
     burnt into the image. This will make all the data on the CD
     visible. If you forget to do this once, e.g. if you did this for
     track three but forgot to do this for track for, do not worry.
     Simply record both track three and track four into the next image
     (track five). If there is no new data in the new image, the track
     will take only seconds to write and uses a minimum of storage
     space on the CD. However, fixing the session will, as usual, cost
     about 13.5 MB.

File list
     Sometimes you want to burn numerous files which are split amongst
     many directories on the hard drive (i.e. they are all over the
     place!). In this case, you should burn using a `File list'.

     When selection this option, you pass MakeCD a file containing the
     names of all the files that you wish to burn.

     Each line in the file list contains the name of a file. If the
     file is 200 lines long, 200 files will be recorded into the ISO
     image.

     The files are read from the cited filenames and are written again
     with the same path. Only the part in front of the first colon (if
     there is a colon) is ignored. For example, `Workbench:SYS/Format'
     would be recorded into the ISO image as `SYS/Format'.

     If you do not want the entire path to be burnt, use an assign:
     `Assign PATH: DH0:Tools'. If you were then to put
     `PATH:RDB-Salv/RDB-Salv.info' into the file list, the file
     `DH0:Tools/RDB-Salv/RDB-Salv.info' would be recorded into the
     image as `RDB-Salv/RDB-Salv.info'.

     Sometimes you want to completely rename the file and/or the file
     path. Again, you can use the file list for this purpose. If you
     enter two colons after the file name in the same line, you can
     then enter the new name immediately after the colons.
     `DH0:Tools.info::HD-Stuff/Utilities.info' would record the file
     `DH0:Tools.info' into the image with the new name
     `HD-Stuff/Utilities.info'.

     An example file list:

          DH0:Disk.info
          PATH:RDB-Salv/RDB-Salv.info::Save/RDB-Salv/RDB-Salv.info
          MakeCD

     The list command that is located in your C directory is very adept
     at creating such file lists. E.g. `List DH0:Tools LFORMAT
     "%p%n::Utilities/%n"'.

     On the other hand, `File list' has a few disadvantages too in
     comparison to `File system':

        · Each object in the file list required significantly more
          memory for creating the file tree.

        · With `File list', the directories are created from scratch
          and are not copied. `File system' simply copies the
          directories. The implications are that `File list' does not
          preserve attributes such as protection bits, directory data
          and comments.

     In view of this, try to use `File system' rather than `File list'.

@{B}Image path
----------@{UB}

One problem faced when an ISO image is created using several sources is
name collision. MakeCD offers you a way to ensure that collisions do
not occur in the first place. Each source can be placed into its own
directory. Simply activate the check box for `Image path' and enter the
name of the directory to be created. The corresponding object will be
copied into the directory that you entered. For example, if you have

@{B}Sort Order
----------@{UB}

The `Sort Order' list enables you to write files that have the same
ending to the same region in the ISO image. Once the first file with
the ending has been read, the CD-ROM drive can usually access the other
files very quickly.

Perhaps you have noticed that CDs which were created using MakeCD
(admittedly other mastering programs too) soon display their icons in
directories, much faster than you would expect. Although a CD-ROM drive
requires between about 1/10th and 2/10ths of a second to access a file,
a directory with 20 icons tends to be displayed in less than 2 to 4
seconds. This is because MakeCD usually saves all `.info' files in the
same region, so that, once the first `.info' file has been accessed,
the following `.info' files are copied into the cache so that they can
be loaded rapidly.

The `Sort Order' list contains the suffixes of the files that you wish
to be saved together in the same region. For example, if you want
`.html' files to be loaded quickly too, add `.html' to the list.

The default is `.info'.

Rock Ridge extensions will be written in the image if you turn on this

File Attributes or full file names (even if the CD was mastered with
ISO 9660 Level 1 or 2).

We recommend that you use this option.

AmiCDFS, AmiCDROM, CacheCDFS, BabelCDROMFS and AsimCDFS (at least the
latest version) support Rock Ridge.

CommodoreCDFS (included with OS 3.1) @{B}does not support Rock Ridge@{UB}, i. e.

@{B}ISO Level
---------@{UB}

A number of limitations are involved with ISO 9660 file and directory
names: only upper-case characters, digits and the underscore `_' are
permitted. There must be one and one dot only in a file name; directory
names themselves cannot contain the dot character. File and directory
names cannot exceed 31 characters in length.

You can ignore this standard if you select `ISO 9660 AMIGA'. This is
because all `AMIGA' CD-ROM file systems that do not support Rock Ridge
(e.g. Commodore CDFS, included with OS 3.1) do not work well under
these restrictions. CDs that have been created using this options will
still work on most systems. However, since MS-DOS systems can have
problems reading such CDs, use this option with care.

ISO 9660 Level 1 creates file names that are fully compatible with
MS-DOS systems. Names are reduced into the 8.3 format.

ISO 9660 Level 2 does not convert to the 8.3 format. However, all other
restrictions above apply.

If your file system supports `Rock Ridge', the level that you enter
here is of little concern, since your file system will display the Rock
Ridge names anyway. However, if you intend to pass on the CD to other
users, you should consider which option is the best one to select.

We recommend that you use `ISO 9660 AMIGA' if the CD is exclusively for
the AMIGA. If you want the CD to be readable on MS-DOS systems too, use
ISO 9660 Level 1 with Rock Ridge extensions.

Turn on this option if you do not want reduced file names to be saved
under ISO 9660 but you would like to make the CD easier to read under
MS-DOS. All ISO names will be converted to upper-case. All other
invalid characters remain unaffected. This option merely converts a-z
to A-Z. Your `AMIGA' will show names predominantly in upper-case, but
at least the CD can be used under MS-DOS -- even though not all files
are guaranteed to be accessible. Schatztruhe GmbH uses this option for
many of their CDs.

If you turn on Rock Ridge too (like Schatztruhe GmbH), you will see the
full Rock Ridge names if you are using a file system that supports Rock
Ridge. The Rock Ridge names themselves will not have been converted.

CDs that have been written with this option can be read problem-free on
the AMIGA and are more compatible with MS-DOS than an `ISO 9660 AMIGA'
CD that was written without this option. And if you do turn on Rock
Ridge, AMIGA users who are using a file system that supports Rock Ridge
will be unable to tell the difference. If you do not turn on Rock
Ridge, or if the target system does not support Rock Ridge, names will
be in upper-case.

You may be wondering how to create an MS-DOS image file. The authors of
MakeCD are faithful to the AMIGA and do not have MS-DOS computers!
However, a kind beta tester has the following advice for you:

  1. Create a bootable floppy on the PC. The floppy must contain a
     CD-ROM driver and CD extensions. Test the floppy. Write-protect
     the floppy to ensure that it is not written to during the boot
     process. If the floppy works and no error messages appear, the
     floppy can be used as a boot image. Use relative path names,
     otherwise the boot image could be identified as your floppy drive!

  2. Make an image file from the floppy. For the `AMIGA', you can
     proceed as follows:

        · Download `dev_hdl.lha' from Aminet and install it (`mount
          dev:').

        · PC0: register (`mount PC0:')

        · `Copy dev:pc0 RAM:osboot.img' This creates a file called
          `RAM:osboot.img'.  This file is your `MS-DOS Image File'.

     A similar process should work for the PC with `Norton DiskEdit'.

In order to create an ISO 9660 image, MakeCD needs to search the source

the search action performed by MakeCD. This window is called the ISO
Write Window.

In the upper region of the window, under Path Search, you are shown how
many files and directories have been searched.

In the lower part of the window, under `Directory/File', you are shown
which file/directory is currently being checked. The display is updated
between one to five times per second, so not every file will appear
here. This saves considerable processor time.

Once scanning has been completed, the total size of the ISO image is
calculated and displayed under `Image File Size'. MakeCD then prepares
the ISO image and starts to write it. `Writing ISO Image' shows how
many files/directories have been written as well as the corresponding
percentage that this represents. `Directory/File' will show you which
file is currently being written to the ISO image.

You can abort the entire operation at any time. This will cause

@{B}Transfer rate
-------------@{UB}

`Transfer rate', which is present in both the Source and Target
windows, often shows a value higher than the technical maximum for the
drive! This is not a bug in MakeCD; neither is your drive somehow
faster than the specifications! Rather, this is a technical phenomenon
relating to your drive's buffer.

For example, this effect can arise if the CD-ROM drive fills its
internal buffer (without your knowledge!) with the next sectors while
the burner is writing the data. When MakeCD requests the next data from
the CD-ROM drive, it receives the data extremely quickly -- directly
from the CD-ROM drive's buffer. MakeCD is not told whether this data
has been sent from the buffer or read afresh, so MakeCD has to show
simply the time it took to receive the data from the drive. For this
reason, the transfer rate shown may at times be higher than the speed
of your CD-ROM drive!

You can choose from the following delete modes:

complete CD-RW, fast
     The content of the medium will be deleted. This is achieved by
     deleting the table of contents. The data itself is not actually
     deleted. In theory, the data proper can still be recovered using
     suitable software. If you want to ensure that all private data is
     deleted, use `Entire CD-RW, slow'.

Entire CD-RW, slow
     The entire content of the medium is deleted. This will take a
     relatively long time. If the data is not sensitive, a quicker
     method is to delete just the table of contents: `complete CD-RW,
     fast'.

Session fixation
     This function deletes the fixation of the last session or the

@{B}Description of Copy CD Window
=============================@{UB}

@{B}Please check the license conditions for any CDs that you would like to
copy. If you flaunt the license conditions, you are breaking the law.@{UB}

You can open the `Copy CD' Window via the menu. You can use this window
to copy entire CDs in Disc-At-Once or Track-At-Once mode. You can copy
the CD using image files or -- if your system is reliable enough --
on-the-fly.

Most of the fields in this window have been explained in the preceding
chapters. See @{"Track options" Link "MIT00"} and @{"Advanced Options" Link "MIF00"}.

We recommend that you set a base directory when using image files.
Please see @{"Base Dir" Link "MITFB"}.

Set `Temporary Images' and `Delete file' as described in @{"Target" Link "MITTG"}.

Use `Write mode' to determine if you wish to burn a CD in Disc-At-Once
mode or Track-At-Once mode. Please note that you must be registered for
Disc-At-Once and that both your CD burner and the MakeCD driver must
support DAO. If you are registered for Track-At-Once only, you can burn
using Disc-At-Once in test mode only! With DAO, MakeCD is able to
create more exact copies than is possible with TAO. That said,
track-at-once is often fine for copying CDs.

If you have settled on Disc-At-Once, set the `Data Format' cycle
gadget. See @{"Data Format" Link "MITFD"}. See @{"Adapt start position" Link "MISHA"}

Usually, `Audio - Adapt start position' can be left as it is. See
@{"Adapt start position" Link "MISHA"}.

If you want to copy in track-at-once mode, set `TAO -- Track starts' as
required. With track-at-once mode, inter-track pauses cannot be
avoided. If there are no pauses between two tracks on your source CD,
MakeCD will record the tracks but add about a two second pause between
them. This causes the second tracks to begin about two seconds later
than from the original CD. `exact (cut audio and data tracks
accordingly)' cuts all of the tracks by about two seconds so that all
the tracks begin at the same position as on the original CD. With Mode2
games CDs you should generally avoid using this mode. The shortening of
audio tracks is not too critical -- at worst you lose two seconds of
music. However, shortening data tracks can render the track unreadable,
so there is a third option: `exact for audio CDs only (cut audio tracks
only)'. In this mode the data tracks are not cut so that all track
start positions which follow a data track are shifted slightly.

Some music CDs have index markings within the tracks. These markings
can be burnt in Disc-At-Once mode (some drives let you burn the
markings in Track-At-Once mode too -- look for confirmation in the
Device Selection Window). Reading the indices adds to the read time,
hence the default turns off this option. If you want the indices to be
read, turn on the `Scan for indices' option. If the scan for index
markings fails or if you do not want to copy the index markings over,
use `Index-Pause' to set the pause index that is required at the end of
the track. Usually you do not need to alter the default setting of two
seconds.

Reading ISRCs (See @{"Advanced Options" Link "MITTO"} noticeably slows down the reading
of audio tracks. If you want the ISRCs to be copied too, turn on `Read
ISRCs'.

Once you have activated all the settings, click on `Copy CD...' to
initiate the copy process, or click on `Setup Project' to start a
project. The project can create a copy of the source CD, but this
option allows you to change modify the copy somewhat.

If you click on `Copy CD...', the Write Window opens. See @{"Write Window" Link "MIW00"}.

If instead you select `Setup Project', a new track list is created and
the Advanced Options are correctly set for you.

If you change your mind and no longer wish to create a copy of the CD,
click on `Abort'.

@{B}Description Of Append complete CD Window
========================================@{UB}

The `Append complete CD Window' can be opened from the menu. Using this
window you can add all the tracks from the source CD after your current
project.

This window is less powerful than the `Copy CD' Window (described in
@{"Copy CD" Link "MIC00"}). If you use this window for copying, some information may
be lost which `Copy CD' would have preserved. However, in contrast to
`Copy CD', the `Append complete CD Window' adds the tracks to your
project. `Copy CD' will delete the previous project. The `Append
complete CD Window' enables you, for example, to create a project that
combines two half-full audio CDs into a single CD-R.

The fields in this window correspond to those in the `Copy CD' window,
with the exception of one new field, `Audio pause'. This overrides the
`Audio Pause' from the Settings window. See @{"Audio pause" Link "MISFP"}.

Once you have changed the settings as required, add the tracks from the
CD in the source device to the current track list by clicking on
`Append CD'. `Abort' quits the function.

......................@{UB}

The AIFF-CD format is a special format which describes how CDs should
appear. Samplitude, for example, can create using this format. This
makes it possible to create a CD in Samplitude, save the project in
AIFF-CD format, then load into MakeCD to burn a CD.

This function adds the tracks that are contained in the AIFF-CD file to
the current project and adopts the relevant information such as catalog
number and write mode. MakeCD can burn the data directly from the
AIFF-CD file, i.e. images do not have to be created.

@{B}Split track between indices
...........................@{UB}

Sometimes we want to split an audio track at certain positions.
MakeCD is by no means a music data editor, but since indices can be set
within the track, the track can be split.

`Split track between indices' splits the track that is marked in the
track list between indices, provided that these exist @{B}within@{UB} the track.
This means that the first and last indices in the list are usually
ignored if they lie at the track start or end.

@{B}MakeCD fundamentals
===================@{UB}

MakeCD is predominantly a track editor. Whether you're copying a CD or
making your own CD from scratch, the tracks are grouped as a list in
the track editor before they are burnt.

For each track you need to define its type (usually a data track or an
audio track), the source of the data (where it is coming from), and
whether you want to automatically have an image file written.

When you are happy with the list, you click either on `Create image
files' to create the image files only, or `Write tracks' to burn all
the tracks consecutively. Any image files that are required are @{B}not@{UB}
automatically created before burning.

@{B}Copying a CD
============@{UB}

As already mentioned, MakeCD allows you to copy a CD. There are a few
settings that you need to make in order to ensure as close a duplicate
as possible (there are several methods of copying a CD). Proceed as
follows:

  1. Configure MakeCD as described in @{"Settings" Link "MIS00"}.

  2. Using the Tools menu, open the `Copy CD' window.

  3. Under `Temporary Images', select if you want to use image files or
     have the data sent directly to the CD. If you have one CD burner
     but no CD-ROM drive, you must burn the CD using image files.

  4. If you want to use image files, use `Base dir' to select the
     directory where the files are to be written. Under `Delete file',
     define when the files are to be automatically deleted.

  5. For `Write mode', chose whether to copy in the Disc-At-Once or
     Track-At-Once mode. The Disc-At-Once mode gives you a more exact
     copy and there are no automatic two second pauses between audio
     tracks. Please note that you may only burn in Disc-At-Once mode if
     this is supported by your burner. In addition, the corresponding
     driver Disc-At-Once must be implemented in MakeCD and you must be
     registered to use Disc-At-Once.

  6. `Data Format' is usually left unchanged. In any case, you can only
     set it in Disc-At-Once mode. If the generated copy does not work
     properly and your burner supports the `Raw Block Contents', try
     again using the `Raw Block Contents' setting.

  7. To ensure the most exact copy, select `Scan for indices' and `Read
     ISRCs'. Some CD burners permit this even when in Track-At-Once
     mode; other burners will only play ball in Disc-At-Once mode.

  8. Click on `Copy...' and follow the instructions. Select the fixing
     mode. For the most identical CD, select `Fix CD-R'. The CD-R will
     then be written.


That's all there is to it! The burned CD-R is as close to an identical
copy as possible.

@{B}Making a Data-CD
================@{UB}

The most common application of burning a data CD is to copy a partition
or a directory to a CD-R. This chapter tells you how this is done.

A simple data CD consists of a data track. Launch MakeCD and add a data
track to the track list. Click on `Add'. You should see the track

appear in the track list.

Next, ensure that the track type and the source are correctly set for
your Track. Use the mouse to select the new track in the track list (in
fact, it's probably selected already) so that it is highlighted. Now,
click on `Track Options...'.

For our example we wish to burn a partition or a complete directory, so
select `File system' as the source. Set the corresponding cycle gadget
to `File system'.

MakeCD cannot tell which file it should burn. So, click on the popup
gadget next to Source. A window opens...

This window shows a list -- all source paths must be entered into the
list. Click on `Add' and check that the cycle gadget for the source
type is set to `File system'.

Having selected the source, choose the type of CD that you wish to
master. Click on `ISO/Rock Ridge...'.

Enter the following values to ensure that the data CD reads well on as
many AMIGAs as possible:

  1. Rock Ridge: on

  2. World access: on

  3. Group access: on

  4. Save AMIGA File attributes: on

  5. ISO 9660 AMIGA

  6. Convert .info suffix to lowercase: on

  7. Convery ISO names to uppercase: off


Now enter `.info' in the `Sort order'list. This will make the CD read
quickly under Workbench.

Leave the window by selecting `Save' or `Use'.

Now your data CD needs a name. Set the `Volume name'. This is the name
that will appear on the Workbench. For `Preparer' enter your name. The
remaining fields can be left empty.

Leave the window by selecting `OK'.

Your next decision is whether to create an image file first, or send
the data direct to the CD.

Decide if you want to create an image file first or have the data sent
directly to the CD burner. Set the cycle gadget for `Target'
correspondingly. If you want to create an image file, enter the
filename in the corresponding text gadget. Sending the data directly to
the CD burner is a more hazardous process, since the performance
requirements are greater and a buffer underflow is more likely. You
should always run in the test mode first to ensure that the system is
running smoothly. You may need to increase the buffer size in the
settings window and/or reduce the burn speed.

We're almost at the finishing post! You now need to click on `Write
tracks'. All image files will be created and written to the CD. Follow
the on-screen instructions.

The write window will appear. Use the window to burn the CD-R in the
test mode or for real. We recommend that you try the test mode first.
In test mode, the same process is used as with real burning, with the
exception that the laser beam of the burner is not turned on i.e. no
permanent changes are made to the CD-R.

In addition, you can set if and when the CD-R should be fixed. More
about this later on. If you are not sure if you want the CD-R to be
fixed, turn off the automatic fixing for now.

Next, click on `Start'. This starts the process.

The process will take some time. We recommend that you leave your AMIGA
to work uninterrupted. It is possible to have other programs running
during the process, for example, a @{B}stable@{UB} word processor is unlikely to
cause problems. However, you @{B}must@{UB} avoid all programs that use the CPU
for a long period at a time at a high priority (and of course any
programs that have a habit of crashing unexpectedly!) - if MakeCD is
ousted from the processor for more than a few seconds (typically 0.5 -
15 seconds, depending on the size of the burner's internal buffer and
the writing speed), your CD burner may experience a buffer underflow. A
buffer underflow can ruin the entire CD-R, making it unusable. At the
very least, the current track is likely to be lost.

@{B}Note:@{UB} reports suggest that some graphics cards use up so much processor
time at such a high priority when changing screens that MakeCD can be
locked out from the processor long enough to cause buffer underflows.
This is @{B}not@{UB} a problem on all systems - try this out for yourself in the
test mode i.e. keep changing the screen while in test mode and see if
there are problems. i.e.: see if you get problems when changing
screens. Incidentally, similar problems can occur when opening large
windows on screens with a high colour depth.

Once MakeCD has burnt the track, either the CD-R is fixed, the session
is fixed, or nothing is fixed - this will depend on the setting you
chose. The MakeCD status display will inform you of any fixation that
takes place. You can now burn another CD-R (which you don't want to do)
or click on `Abort'. Click on `Abort'.

If the CD-R or the session was fixed, take out the CD-R and try reading
it from your CD-ROM drive. You can add data later if you fixed the
session only.

If there was no fixation, use the menu to select `Fix session' (select
this if you want to add more data to the CD-R later on) or `Fix CD-R'
(select this if you are sure that no more data is to be added to the
CD-R).

We've finished creating our data CD! Now try reading the CD-R from a
CD-ROM drive!

If you want to try out the CD in your CD writer, it may be possible --
depending on the make of your burner -- to read the CD without actually
fixing anything! This can save a lot of space on the CD-R, but bear in
mind that you must fix the CD-R if you want to read it on a standard
CD-ROM drive.

Note: You can create the image files @{B}without@{UB} burning a CD by clicking
on `Write tracks' instead of `Create image files'. You can create the
image files @{B}without@{UB} burning a CD immediately! It doesn't matter if the
CD-R that you want to burn the image to is empty. If the CD-R already
contains data, MakeCD has to access the CD-R in order to determine how
to create the image. More precisely: MakeCD determines the start block
on the CD-R for burning the image file. In the case of empty CD-Rs, the
start block will be block 0. Not to worry -- a dialog window will make
you aware of the condition and allow you to act upon it.

@{B}Making an Audio-CD
==================@{UB}

An audio CD usually has several tracks. There is normally one piece of
music per track. Each track has a number by which it can be referenced
-- this is the track number displayed by CD players.

Arrange the music data in the track list. The first entry in the list
corresponds to the first piece of music, the second entry corresponds
to the second piece of music, etc.

You can copy music directly from other CDs or load them from files.
Files must be in the CDDA format (this is the raw format as read from
CDs) or in the `AIFF' format (16 bit stereo at 44.1kHz). MakeCD
automatically recognizes the format and converts it during burning into
data which the CD burner recognizes.

You can use MakeCD to make a CD which takes its tracks from a number of
different music CDs as well as data read from a file. MakeCD will
prompt you to insert the CDs as they are required during the copy
process. You can also make copies, even if you have just the one drive.

The following sections help you create your first music CD.

Start by setting the `Track type' cycle gadget to `Audio (normal)'and
the `Type' for `Source' to `Image file' (if you want to read most of
the data from files) or to `Track from CD' (if you want to read most of
the data from another CD). This is not essential, but it saves you a
little work later on. The gadget settings can be different for each
track in the track list. However, the settings from the previous entry
are copied for each new entry in the track list.

If most of your tracks will use image files, set the cycle gadget
`Target' to `Use image file', otherwise, set it to `Direct to CD
writer'. This setting can be changed later on for each track, but why
not make life easier and set the default to the most frequent setting?
We recommend that you use image files to begin with if you have
sufficient hard drive space.

`Delete file' can also be set separately for each track. You can set
when the temporary image files should be automatically deleted. If you
set `Never', you will have to delete the image files yourself.

Save these settings using `Save current gadget state' from the menu -
the defaults will help save time later on.

We have taken care of the settings. Now we want to create a CD with the
following structure:

     1. Music piece from CD A (piece 3), with image file 2. Music piece
     from CD B (piece 2), without image file 3. Music piece from an
     available AIFF file 4. Music piece from an available CDDA file 5.
     Music piece from CD C (piece 5), without image file

To begin with, let's add a track in the track list for each music
piece. We will also adjust the settings for each track.

Track 1 (CD A, Track 3, with image file)
     Click on `Add' to create the first track. Next, set the `Type' for
     `Source' to `Track from CD'. Now, insert a music CD in your read
     drive and click on the `Source' popup gadget.

     A track selection window opens. Click on `Update CD-R writer' to
     read the contents on the CD. We want to record the third music
     piece to our CD, so click on the third entry in the track
     selection window list. If you know the song title, type it (or an
     abbreviation) into `Name' - please avoid using the space
     character. Leave the track selection window by clicking on `OK'.
     The `Track type' is automatically set to the correct value when
     you leave the track selection window, so you needn't change `Track
     type'.

     We want to create an image file for the first track, so make sure
     that `Target' is set to `Use image file'. Then, enter a name for
     the track in `Image file' - this name is used when the track is
     saved to the hard drive. MakeCD may suggest a name for you - by
     all means change this to a more appropriate entry.

     You must enter an appropriate path for the image file. Image files
     use considerable storage space - about 173 KB per second for audio
     data. Make sure that the partition you select has sufficient free
     space. If you want to save all image files to the same directory,
     you can enter the directory in `Base dir'. This directory will be
     used for @{B}all@{UB} objects with a relative path. If you leave `Base dir'
     empty, use absolute paths only (i.e. names containing a colon).

     We have finished defining the first track. Now to define the
     second track...

Track 2 (CD B, Piece 2, no image file)
     Click on `Add' to create the next track. Set the `Type' for
     `Source' to `Track from CD'. Insert another audio CD, and click on
     the gadget again. The track selection window opens.

     Select `Update'. In the track selection window, select track 2 and
     enter a name in `Name'. Leave the window using `OK'. `Track type'
     is automatically set to the correct value when you leave the track
     selection window.

     Set `Target' to `Direct to CD writer'.

@{I}          NB: select `Use image file' as described above if you have
          selected the @{B}same@{UB} device for reading and writing in the
          Settings window.  MakeCD can only copy tracks directly if the
          source and the target drives are different!  @{UI}

     We have finished defining the second track!

Track 3 (AIFF-File)
     Please skip this part if you do not have an AIFF file.

     Otherwise, click on `Add' to create a new track. Set `Track type'
     to `Audio (normal)'. Set `Source' to select `Image file'. This
     means that MakeCD is to read the data from an image file.

     Click on the `Source' popup gadget. The track selection window
     does not open this time. Instead, a file selection window appears
     - MakeCD realizes that you want to read an existing image file and
     not a track.

     Select the AIFF file and close the file selection window using
     `OK'.

     MakeCD can convert AIFF files into data that your CD burner
     understands very quickly, so enter the target as `Direct to CD
     writer'. You could, theoretically, create an image file - this
     would contain the data in the same form that is eventually sent to
     the CD burner. However, this is usually unnecessary.

     We have finished setting up the AIFF file!

     Track 4 (CDDA Data) Please skip this part if you do not have a
     CDDA file.

     Otherwise, proceed as with track 3, but choose a CDDA file instead
     of an AIFF file. MakeCD automatically recognizes the CDDA file and
     sends the data to the CD burner. MakeCD will change the byte
     sequence if necessary.

@{B}     Note:@{UB} CDDA data must be in the exact byte sequence selected in the
     settings window - otherwise you will end up with a terrible,
     ringing data noise

     There is no point in creating an image file for CDDA data, so
     select `Direct to CD writer'.

     Track 5 (CD C, Piece 5, no image file) Finally, we want to add
     another track from a third CD. This should be the fifth track.

     You should now be able create this track without additional help.
     This time we do @{B}not@{UB} want to create an image file.

The most difficult part is over! We are going to create image files in
the following section. We will then be able to listen to the results,
and finally, we can burn the CD!

Click on `Create image files' to create the image files. Follow the
on-screen instructions.

If the image files were written, click on `Play audio'. A window
containing a few gadgets opens. Click on `Start'. You should soon be
able to hear the data using your AMIGA loudspeakers. You can skip
within the current track or between the tracks, and alter the volume
and lowpass filter.

Close the window once you have finished checking the tracks. We are now
ready to write the tracks. Click on `Write tracks'.

The write window opens. Use `Write mode' to burn in the test mode (no
permanent changes will be made to the CD-R) or to burn without the test
mode (the CD will be written for real!). You can also select to run the
test mode first and @{B}then@{UB} burn if no problems are encountered.

You must now choose if, and how, the tracks are fixed following a
successful write process.

You cannot add further audio tracks if you fix the session, only data
tracks. The written tracks can be read by a CD player immediately
afterwards.

You cannot add further tracks if you fix the CD-R. The written tracks
can be read by a CD player immediately afterwards.

You can add more audio tracks if you do not fix the session or the
CD-R. However, the written tracks can only be read by your CD burner.

After making your choice, click on `Start'. Then, avoid using your
AMIGA in such a way that could cause a crash or lead to a buffer
underflow - avoid using "greedy" applications (those which use the
processor for a long time at a high priority). A buffer underflow ruins
the current track and can even destroy the entire CD-R.

Please read the following sections for trouble-shooting.

Buffer Overrun/Buffer Overrun
     It is possible to copy audio tracks directly: the source drive and
     the target drive must run at exactly the same speed. You can set
     the read speed separately for audio tracks, but some CD-ROM
     drivers ignore this value. If the read speed cannot be set, make
     sure you set the target drive to the same speed as the source
     drive. Many CD-ROM drives transfer CDDA at single speed only.

     The direct copying of audio tracks is a time-critical operation.
     This is because the source drive cannot pause once it has started
     to transfer audio data. We strongly recommend that you try the
     test mode first. In case of doubt, we recommend that you use image
     files.

Track M requires "Audio (normal)" with Block Size 2352
     This message usually appears if you try to read CDDA data.
     MakeCD can only recognize if the data is CDDA in the following
     way: MakeCD checks to see if the data has a recognized format. If
     the format is not recognized, MakeCD checks if the file length is
     divisible by 2352 - all audio data from CD is divisible by 2352.
     If you recorded the data yourself, the file is unlikely to be
     divisible by 2352 and you need to set the `Audio length' from
     `Block' to `any' (in the `Further settings' window). The
     disadvantage: it is then possible to select @{B}any@{UB} file, i.e. you
     could select a file which is totally unrelated to CDDA!

@{B}Registration by E-mail
----------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} Please send me my registration number by e-mail.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} This is unfortunately not possible for several reasons:

  1. Katrin Schmidt is not on the Internet.

  2. Even @{B}beta@{UB} versions have gone "missing" by e-mail, only to end up
     on some cracked/copied boards. We have no intention to help this
     code-crackers in any way, so we will in future make no attempt to
     facilitate orders by e-mail. This is the only way we can be sure
     of obtaining the real address of every registered person, thereby
     enabling us to track down code-crackers and take legal action. If
     we didn't fight piracy, we would not be able to continue
     developing for the AMIGA.

Katrin Schmidt deals with registrations very quickly (with the
exception of holidays). In any case, a CD burning program isn't usually
something you need within 24 hours. It is normally part of a
longer-term plan.

@{B}Credit Cards
------------@{UB}

@{B}Question@{UB}: I would like to pay by VISA (or another credit card). Is this
possible?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} No. Our turnover is to small and as such we cannot accept
payment by credit card.

However, MakeCD is sold by a number of companies that can accept
payment by credit card.

@{B}Question@{UB}: Hi. Have you received my registration yet?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} Please only ask us if you feel that the registration is taking
an unusually long time. If this is the case, please contact Katrin,
since Patrick and Angela themselves do not handle incoming
registrations. Katrin usually processes the registrations once per week
at the weekend. This means a maximum wait of about one week in addition
to the time that the registration is in the post.

Sometimes Katrin is on holiday. During this period, registrations can
take a little longer.

@{B}Bank transfer of the Registration fee
-------------------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question@{UB}: I'd like to pay the registration fee with a bank transfer.
Please give me your account number.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} We purposefully avoid bank transfers. The name and address is
all too often unclear on the account statement and we are unable to
send the Registration. Also, there are organizational difficulties
caused by such payments. We have experienced so many problems from a
relatively small number of bank transfers that we no longer accept
payment in this way.

@{B}Methods of payment outside Germany
----------------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question@{UB}: I don't live in Germany, but I would like to order MakeCD.
How can I get the money to you?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} You have several options

Eurocheque in DM
     This is probably the best method for everyone. Please @{B}don't@{UB} make
     the cheque out in your local currency, but in DM. We can cash
     Eurocheques in DM with minimal costs, but Eurocheques in other
     currencies come hand-in-hand with extra charges.

Cheque drawn on a German bank
     Our bank used to cash cheques from abroad without charging a fee
     so long as a German partnership was on the cheque. Now our bank
     charges at least 10 DM to cash such a cheque. That can be half of
     the fee! If you want to send us a cheque made out to a German
     bank, you need to add another 10 DM to cover our costs.

Money order (German or international)
     You need to go to a post office and fill in the form to get the
     money in DM to us by post. This is a safe method. Try to send your
     registration form at the same time, but make sure you enter your
     full address and the purpose of the money on the money order --
     just in case your registration form is lost in the post. Then we
     can still send you MakeCD if your letter goes missing.

     When sending money orders from abroad, please use an international
     money order with Germany as the destination country. Michael
     Habermann `<drmike@peabody.jhu.edu>' sent money from the USA.  He
     wrote:

@{I}          I went to the Post Office. I filled out a form with my name
          and yours, enclosed a money order for $XX, but there were
          additional fees of about $7.50 for processing the
          transaction. The form and the money order were sent to
          International Money Orders in St. Louis, Missouri and they
          converted my USA money order into a German money order which
          you can cash at any bank. They mail it directly to you, and
          they say it takes about 4-6 weeks.

          You are right, apparently not too many people use this
          service, even the Postmaster told me that, and the person at
          the desk gave me the wrong information: He said that in a few
          weeks International Money Orders would send ME the converted
          money order that I would then send to you! Reading the
          information on the form I had to correct the postal worker on
          this. So it is not an everyday transaction.

          Not all USA post offices sell International money orders,
          although I think all of them sell regular USA money orders.
          You might inform your other customers of the procedure I
          followed.  @{UI}

     Please note: although the money order was supposedly on its
     travels For 4-6 weeks, we had it within 1-2 weeks and were able to
     deal with it right away.

Cash
     This is of course sent at your own risk. Simply go to your bank
     and get Some German bank notes. Some people send the money with
     registered post, but this does not guarantee 100% safety. But the
     money usually reaches us. We once had a letter from Italy with the
     money missing. We couldn't be sure, due to the nature of the
     envelope, if it had been opened by someone else. It's possible
     someone stole it.

Cheque from your bank
     Cheques from outside Germany that do not fall under the above
     categories can cost us about 20 DM to cash. This amount is
     deducted by our bank from the amount you have written on the
     cheque. So in this case you need to add an extra 20 DM to the
     cheque. In your own interest, why not see if any of the above
     methods work out cheaper for you?

Buying from an AMIGA-Firm
     A number of companies sell MakeCD. If you have a local supplier,
     this could the best option for you.

If you send a cheque, please write the name as "Schmidt" or "Frau
Schmidt". This allows either Katrin or Angela to cash the cheque.

@{B}Question@{UB}: If I want to register with you, the authors, rather than an

@{B}Answer:@{UB} We have enough on our plates with the programming and simply
don't have time to personally deal with registrations. In any case,
Katrin has a much faster turnover than we could manage. Katrin is
Angela's younger sister and she appreciates the extra pocket money. By
the way, Katrin especially likes talking to @{B}nice@{UB} people over the phone,

@{B}(Latest version of MakeCD
-------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I am a registered user of MakeCD and would like the latest
version. Where can I get it from?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} If you have Internet access, simply visit our homepage:
`http://makecd.core.de/'.

If you do not have Internet access, please contact the company that
supplied you with MakeCD.

If you registered MakeCD directly with the authors, you can use the
registration form to order a free demo version (you pay the postage and
packaging only - 5 DM within Europe, 10 DM outside Europe). This offer
is limited to one floppy per letter. Enter your registration number in
this demo version to turn it into a new, registered version.

Please tell us which version you are using. We will send you the
current version if you do not do this, which is a waste of money if you
already have it!

You can save yourself time by paying for updates in advance. For
example, if you would like to be sent the next three updates, please
send us three times the postage and packaging fee (in this case 15 DM
within Europe, 30 DM outside Europe) with a covering letter stating
that you would like to be sent the next three updates. Please don't
take this to excesses - there may not be as many updates as you pay for!

Incidentally, you do not have to be registered to order the demo
version. The offer is open to all unregistered users too, who perhaps
are using old versions of MakeCD and are interested to see what the
latest version offers.

@{B}Support
-------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} Hello authors of MakeCD. Where is your answer to my book of
questions? I'm still having problems and expect you to solve these for
me. I have tried to contact you several times by telephone, and why is
telephone support only one hour daily?. Where is the service? So, what
have I got to do to reduce the number of faulty CDs? And how do I burn
a data CD?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} The fee that you paid is to use @{B}the program@{UB}, not to use the
authors! We're more than to support our registered users, but not if
they can't be bothered to read even the introduction (apart from our
telephone number and e-mail address). We get pretty angry at people
like you. We don't write the instructions so that we can read them out
to you. Your grandmother can do that! The daily limit of one hour
telephone support per day is essential, otherwise we get constantly
interrupted when we should be updating MakeCD. There's nothing more
frustrating than time on the telephone to someone who wont read
instructions.

If you have questions that are not answered in the instructions, we are
more than happy to help you. Please do your bit by reading the docs
first. Unnecessary questions cost us a lot of time and harm the
development of MakeCD.

By the way, the money we make from MakeCD is nowhere near enough to pay
two full-time programmers. We are still students with other obligations
too, which have suffered to make @{B}programname@{UB} what it is today. However,
our professional future is more important to us than the small income
we make. If you don't understand that, fair enough, why not try a
different software package?

Finally, I must point out that we try our best to help with questions
that are not covered in the instructions. Our support is much better
than that of a good many commercial firms.

@{B}Question:@{UB} I have a Philips CDD 2600 and when reading audio CDs with
this burner many errors occur -- especially when I try to read the

@{B}Answer:@{UB} This is the official response from Philips:
@{I}     Tests have shown that the CDD2600 is not 100% reliable when
     reading audio CDs or packet written CDs at 6x speed. This problem
     is caused by the hardware and can *not* be solved via a firmware
     upgrade.

     The current revision of our firmware is 1.07. We officially

You can get round the problem by reducing the speed for audio CDs in

@{B}HP/Philips will not read small data tracks
------------------------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} My HP burner (presumably a Philips) will not read pressed CDs
with just one track (a small data track).

@{B}Answer:@{UB} This is the official response from HP:
@{I}     HP is aware of an issue reading certain pressed CD-ROM disks with
     a single track. The most important factor relating to this problem
     is the data size of the disk. Disks with more than 27 MB are
     likely @{B}not@{UB} to have this problem. The less data on the disc, the
     bigger the chance the CD cannot be read.

     Only a very small percentage of CD-ROM disks fall in this
     category. However there are two CD-R specific applications which
     may be affected:
       1. Adaptec Easy CD Pro

       2. Seagate Backup.

     Analysis of the issue is almost complete as of mid-April. Due to
     component level work that needs to occur, a delivery date for the
     fix in not yet available. An exchange will ultimately need to
     occur when the fix is available.

     Communication has gone out to small application developers and
     should minimize the issue in the long term. Updates will be
     communicated via the WWW at http://www.hp.com/isgsupport/cdr/ as
     to when the fix will be made available.

     While work is being completed by HP and its partners to fix the
     issue, it is recommended that the disc be read by a standard
     CD-ROM in the system.

@{B}Write append error
------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB}

I frequently operate my HP 4020 CD-burner (or Philips CDD 2000,
Grundig, or similar) in test mode and everything runs perfectly. But if
I turn off the test mode, after a while the CD-Rs are trashed.
MakeCD responds with: "write append error". This has never happened in
test mode, but is very frequent when test mode is off. My friend has
the same CD-burner. He did not have this problem when the burner was
new, but now, some time later, he is getting the same problems. What
has gone wrong?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} You most probably have a faulty CD-burner. You burner needs to
be repaired. A new firmware or a new version of MakeCD will not help in
this case.

A user on claimed on Internet that HP expressed surprise that a user
managed to burn 200 blanks using a SureStore 4020 before this error
occurred.

Alexander Becker <alex@enjoy.regio.net> reported in
<5eu67r$1q0@enjoy.regio.net> on 25.2.1997 that HP sent him new blanks
without objection after he called them and faxed in the bill - he also
claimed that he was even refunded the cost of the burner.

Other users have even exchanged their burners two or three times --
without long-term success -- and have eventually been refunded.

One of the beat testers for MakeCD has told us that the following firms
has good support for defect burners:

Repair 2000 Hardware Service GmbH
Werkstrasse 5
22844 Norderstedt
Deutschland
Tel.: 040 5225031 (ask for Mr. Peter and describe the problem)
Fax: 040 5264811

If you are dexterous, you may be able to resolve the problem by
thoroughly cleaning the burner yourself (remove any dust, and oil the
carriage with a suitable lubricant). Any repair that you attempt is at
your @{B}own risk@{UB} and we cannot and will not offer you further advice on
repairing units yourself.

If you are using the Philips CDD 2000 or similar make sure that you are
using the latest firmware version. For example, version 1.21 can lead
to considerable SCSI problems.

@{B}Yamaha thinks CD-R cannot be written to
---------------------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I have a Yamaha CDR100 and write a track to the second
session in test mode. I then try to write for real, and the burner
suddenly reports that the inserted medium cannot be written to?!

@{B}Answer:@{UB} Yamaha CDR100/102s sometimes appear to have problems with the
update after writing in the test mode. Existing tracks are no longer
listed, and the CD-R is no longer seen as a CD-R, but as a normal CD.
This was reproduced several times, and each time the output in the
target CDR window was different.

In this case all you can do is take out the CD-R and insert it again.
Unfortunately, this means that the automatic "Write after test" is no
longer possible.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} This seems to be a SCSI problem. Some people have no problems

@{B}JVC problems
------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I am using a JVC burner and am experiencing numerous
problems. When will there be a driver that works properly?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} The problem is not so much the driver, but rather the defective
firmware of the JVC XR-W2010 V1.51. You can read more about this under:
`doc/Compatibility'. The major problems are:

Reading transfers defective data without error report.
     If you have a Meetins Pearls III or IV, register your JVC burner
     as a CD-ROM drive, insert the Meeting Pearls and click on
     `English'. An amigaguide document should appear with a link which
     can be used to check the CD. Try checking the CD! If faulty files
     are shown without a read/write error, your JVC burner is most
     probably transferring defective data without error reports!

Rejection of write commands Under certain conditions
     Some JVC CD burners apparently reject write or fix commands with
     `ILLEGAL COMMAND'. This can sometimes be solved by shortening the
     SCSI bus (as Patrick found) or by using another, better medium (as
     we were told by JVC). Try both! Also, a heat problem was reported
     (the burner was getting to warm in a casing with a poor fan). In
     one case the casing had been tightened so much that the burner was
     slightly warped and developed a mechanical problem.

Other errors

@{B}SCSI problems
-------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I have a big problem. Nothing seems to work. MakeCD or the
SCSI bus keeps hanging. What can I do about this?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} Your CD-burner and/or your SCSI host adapter is faulty. Sorry,
but we are unable to help you in this instance. Please check our
compatibility list - perhaps you will find a user there with a similar
configuration who has managed to resolve the problem.

If this doesn't help, try the following -- in test mode!

   · Select a small chunk size (32 or 64KB) in the settings window and
     see it that helps. We have been told that this helps with some
     Phase 5 host adapters.

   · The chunk size plays a major part as to whether hanging occurs
     with the Philips CDD 2600 (and possibly with other CD-burners).
     Some people report hanging when the chunk size is too @{B}small@{UB}, but
     in our experience hanging occurs when the chunk size is too @{B}large@{UB}.
     You may need to experiment a little here.

   · Some customers have told us that their Philips burners have never
     hung up, even though they are using the same interface as other
     people who are experiencing system hanging. However, those without
     problems have changed their SCSI chop "WD-04" for a SCSI chip of
     type "WD-08". Try changing your SCSI chip too.

   · Turn off parallel read/write in the settings window and then
     test. If you turn off parallel read/write, the buffer will be
     constantly almost empty. This is normal but also more dangerous
     since a buffer underflow is more likely. In this case there is
     little point in selecting a large buffer. 1MB should be more than
     sufficient.

   · Turn off reselection for all devices, especially for the
     CD-burner. We have included a small tool with most versions of
     MakeCDto turn off reselection for Commodore's V39/V40 scsi.device.
     If this helps, experiment with reselection until you establish
     which devices can have reselection turned on and which devices
     must have reselection turned off. If reselection is turned off,
     the same applies to the buffer behaviour as described above.

   · Carsten Schlute (formerly with phase5) has tipped setting the
     CD-burner to a lower ID number than the hard drive which is being
     read. This can sometimes help with phase5 hardware and possibly
     other hardware.

   · If nothing helps, try borrowing another host adapter and see if
     the results are any better. Turn off reselection for the
     CD-burner, but turn on parallel read/write.

@{B}SCSI problems and buffer underruns
----------------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I keep getting "buffer underruns" or the SCSI hangs. What can
I do about this?

@{B}Answer (by `John Hendrikx <john@globalxs.nl>')@{UB}: I experimented with
"Buffer Underruns" while reselection was turned off for my CD burner.
This prevented the hard drive from doing anything while the CD burner
used the SCSI bus (which can be for long periods at a time). Turning on
reselection for both my burner and my hard drive occasionally led to
SCSI errors. When I turned on reselection for my CD burner only,
everything worked wonderfully. There was hardly any change in speed,
since the hard drive (for which reselection had been turned off) did
not use the bus for long anyway.

I have burnt CDs successfully at four-speed using the Yamaha writer,
even though I have just an 030 system with 22 MHz and 8MB FastRAM. The
data came from an IDE drive (I imagine that the additional IDE
controller simplified things).

Here, nonetheless, are a few tips:

   · If you feel that your hard drive is too slow, try running ReOrg.

   · Use large block sizes on your image partition. I use 2 KB blocks
     on all image partitions (perhaps even larger values would help,
     but I like to use these partitions as normal partitions too. This
     reduces fragmentation effects on your hard drive.

   · Try the reselection settings for your SCSI device. Reselection
     does not need to be turned on for all fast drives (e.g. hard
     drives) but it should be turned on for the CD burner (I have
     turned off reselection for all drives bar the burner -- works very
     well). If you want to see the difference that reselection makes,
     try the following :turn on parallel read/write, write a large
     image file to a CD (test mode). Now use a reselection tool and
     turn on/off reselection for the burner. The moment it's turned
     off, the buffer becomes smaller and smaller. Once it is turned on
     again, the buffer fills within seconds (things might possibly be
     different with your system, but try it anyway.

   · If you suspect that your SCSI interface is simply too slow, or if
     turning on reselection for the burner leads to SCSI errors, try to
     read the data from a different SCSI interface (a second SCSI
     interface or an IDE controller).

Incidentally, turning off reselection for your hard drives even
improves the speed (at least if only one of them is used at a time). I
got up to 20% improvement.

@{B}Question:@{UB} I'm having problems with the PPC-SCSI. Among other things a
CD-R that I burnt had corrupt data at the start of a track. What can I

@{B}Answer:@{UB}
  1. Use the latest version of cybppc.device (see `ftp.phase5.de'.
     Also, use at least version 3.1a of MakeCD.

  2. Check SCSI termination: It is well known that incorrect
     termination can lead to burning problems with reselection turned
     on.

  3. Always try things once without reselection. If the errors appear
     only with reselection on, then, according to Phase5, there could
     be a problem with incorrect termination. In our experience, some
     users had this problem even with termination correctly
     administered. Nonetheless consult your Phase5 manual, ask other
     users for help, or contact Phase5. The authors of MakeCD are not
     responsible for problems with your SCSI interface!

  4. Data errors can arise during burning due to corrupt media or an
     incorrect write speed. Try other brands and use them at the speeds
     that they are intended for.

  5. If you still have problems, turn to Phase 5 for support if it
     seems to be a general SCSI problem, or approach the authors of
     MakeCD. Please tell us that you have already tried the steps
     listed above. We also need a detailed description of your system

-------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} My Oktagon keeps hanging when I read or write audio or Mode2
tracks. Will a new version of the Oktagon device help?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} This problem is evident with all currently available versions
of the Oktagon device (i.e. up to and including version 6.12). You must
turn off reselection for the unit of the CD writer or ROM drive using
the OktagonPrefs program, otherwise the data transfer will only work
with tracks with a block size of 2048 bytes.

Other sources recommend turning off reselection and synchronous for @{B}all@{UB}
devices attached to the Oktagon and setting the chunk size to 256KB. In
addition, you should set `softXC???oktagon.device' as the device driver
in place of `oktagon.device'.

Oliver Kastl has written a new driver for the Oktagon. You can download
the new driver, called Oktopussy, at `http://www.elaborate-bytes.com/'.

@{B}Audio data with Oktagon
-----------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} My Oktagon-SCSI interface is reading audio data very slowly.
How can I improve the rate?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} We don't have experience ourselves with this problem, but we
can pull on the experience of our customers: Hannes Welser
`<welser@geocities.com>' told us how he got the Oktagon to read faster:

If the reading of audio data is slow, he turns off his computer for a
brief moment, turns it on again, and then sends an update command to
the CD-ROM drive and the burner. He does this using the Target CD_R
window and the Track selection window. Upon that, his Plextor drive
reads CDDA at about 8speed. He tries this in test mode until it's
ready, then he burns for real.

He had to reduce the reading speed to 8speed, since higher speeds led
to hanging problems occasionally. He used a small value for the chunk
size (32 - 36 KB).

This was tried with versions 6.8 and 6.12 (the versions string thought
it was 6.10) of the oktagon.device running on an A4000/040 with 25MHz
and a Plextor 12/20 TSI CD-ROM drive and Grundig IPW100 CD burner.

Oliver Kastl's `<olli@elaborate-bytes.com>' new Oktapussy driver should
solve the problem with the audio data.

@{B}Buffer underrun
---------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I am experiencing "Buffer underruns". Under which conditions
can these occur?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} There are various possible causes:

   · Your read device is transferring the data too slowly.

   · Your SCSI interface is transferring the data too slowly to your
     write device.

   · Your read device has "hung up" and is no longer transferring data.

   · Your write device has "hung up" and is no longer collecting data.

   · Another device is blocking the SCSI bus for a few seconds, in
     which time the internal buffer of your burner empties.

   · The chunks that you are using are either too large or too small.
     A chunk should be no larger than half the buffer size of your CD
     burner. 50 KB seems to work well.

   · Another program using `Forbid()' or with a higher priority is
     taking over the processor for a number of seconds. Some customers
     have reported that changing the screen with some graphics cards
     can contribute to a buffer underrun.

   · Burn at single speed.

   · If you are able too, increase the buffer size for MakeCD.

@{B}AIFF length incorrect
---------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I have converted sound data into AIFF, but when I select the
file, MakeCD reports the AIFF file length as incorrect. Why doesn't
adjusting the audio length help?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} The exact error message is presumably as follows:

@{I}     Source file »filename« has wrong type »wrong AIFF« or wrong size 0.
     Track 1 requires »Audio (normal)« with block size 2352.  @{UI}

The error in this case is not the result of the size, but the format of
the file. It is indeed an AIFF file, but it does not contain audio data
that can be burnt directly to the CD (see the question regarding
supported formats).

The setting for the audio length is only used for data without addition
information. So, for AIFF, it is ignored.

@{B}Audio conversion programs
-------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I'm very interested in the audio aspect and would like to
edit the sound data before I burn it to CD. Which software packages do
you recommend?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} We don't have experience of this ourselves, but here's what our
customers say:

Federico Pomi `<Fede@AmyResource.it>' recommends @{B}AudioLab2 from
Maurizio Ciccione@{UB}. He says there are numerous versions depending on the
sound card you have. The list shows which version you need for your
hardware:

SoundStagePro
SoundStage
     AudioLabR2-SoundStage

DelfinaPro
Delfina
DelfinaLite
     AudioLabR2-Delfina

Prelude
     AudioLabR2-Prelude

Toccata
DracoAudio
AmigaAudio
     AudioLabR2-Standard

The special versions are intended to use the specific card as
efficiently as possible.

The software should also recognize the major audio formats (e.g. AIFF,
MAUD, MAESTRO, WAVE, SUN, STUDIO16_3, 8SVX, RAW).

There are numerous methods to edit the sound wave, e.g. with
Cut/Copy/Paste, or by mixing up to 16 channels. AudioLab2 works
exclusively with the topaz/8 font. There is a heavily restricted
version on Aminet. There is conflicting data about the price. Someone
said the software would cost us USD45. Glenn Mrosek wrote to us
explaining that he had already paid USD 45 and was supposed to spend
another USD 50 for an update. Floyd Diebel said that the software now
costs USD 125 and is distributed by the author's firm. Glenn Mrosek
told us that there were two versions (Pro and Standard).

Adam Hough `<adamh@spots.ab.ca>' recommends @{B}Soundprobe from HiSOFT@{UB}. It
does not have as many features as AudioLab2, but it can be easier to
understand and has good support for the 16 bit formats. Please contact
HiSOFT for details: `http://www.hisoft.co.uk/soundprobe/'. The
IFF-8SVX, AIFF(8/16-bit), WAV(8/16-bit) and RAW formats can be read.
Formats that can be written include AIFF(16-bit), a format recognized
by MakeCD. Soundprobe offers many special effects, supports sound cards
and can save to RAM or directly to hard disk. There is also an
undo/redo function and clever allows you to edit parts of the sample
not in main memory but on the hard drive. HiSOFT recommend an 060 board
and a defragmented hard drive for recording at 44.1 kHz 16-bit stereo.
Soundprobe costs about UKP 25. A new version of Soundprobe, version 2,
is imminent at time of writing!

Torsten (mac) Buecheler `<mac@cs.uni-sb.de>' recommends @{B}Samplitude from
SEKD@{UB}. He especially likes being able to edit data which in not in
memory but is stored on the hard drive.

Torsten Buecheler `<mac@cs.uni-sb.de>' uses AmiSOX 3.3, ported from
UNIX. Like many UNIX programs, AmiSOX has a command line interface.
AmiSOX converts sound data from one format to another and can perform
sound effects. The data types include AIFF, 8SVX, voc, WAV and RAW. The
program can be freely copied and can be found on Aminet under
`mus/edit/AmiSOX33.lha'.

Glenn Mrosek `<Gremlin@I-Memory.dame.de>' suggests Audio Thunder (from
Asimware), AudioLab and Samplitude, which can all edit the sample
without it having to fully reside in memory.

Andreas Thedens `<thedi@amt.comlink.de>' advises not to use Samplitude
with MakeCD since it cannot save in the AIFF format. From version
@{B}SamplitudeOpus V3.5@{UB} (according to Friedhelm Bunk
`balu-bu@t-online.de') this no longer applies. This version apparently
reads and writes CDDA L/M, AIFF, WAVE, MAUD, MAESTRO and IFF 8SVX. You
can download a demo at `http://www.act-net.com'.

Jens Maertens <sysop@outreach.prometheus.de> suggests `SoundConvert'
from Aminet. Simply download it from `mus/edit/SoundConvert.lha'.
SoundConvert supports many formats, including AIFF, WAV, IFF 8SVX, MP2
and MP3. You can also change the sampling rate. Jens uses SoundConvert
and MakeCD to change audio CDs to MPEG Layer 2, letting him burn about
130 songs to a single CD. Such CDs can then be played on the Melody
sound card. Jens also likes the user interface.

@{B}Interference with audio data
----------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I hear interference when I read audio data using MakeCD. How
do I get rid of this noise?

@{B}Answer:@{UB}
   · The majority of people with this problem are using AsimCDFS.
     Asimware suggest that you update the file system to version 3.9.
     This problem arises because AsimCDFS keeps communicating with the
     drive, even though MakeCD has told the file system to leave the
     drive alone. This is not a problem with Asimware from version 3.9
     upwards.

   · If you are using a file system other than AsimCDFS, try turning
     it off to see if the problem disappears.

   · If you have another tool running that can affect the CD-ROM
     drive, turn it off.

   · A user of MakeCD traced poor audio data back to CyberPatcher. If
     you have started CyberPatcher, try turning it off.

   · Somebody told us that he had such a problem as soon as a Zip
     drive is connected to the same SCSI bus. Once the Zip drive is
     removed, the problem disappears. Another person told us that he
     experienced more interference when reselection was turned on than
     when it was turned off. The best method is to save the data into
     RAM or to use a massive buffer. So try turning off reselection for
     all drives and remove any SCSI drives that you can from the SCSI
     bus.

   · Check the termination of your SCSI bus.

We cannot think of other reasons why the CDDA data should be of poor
quality. That said, it can sometimes be down to a hardware problem with
the CD-ROM. A new, modern CD-ROM drive is often the solution.

@{B}Audio data varied
-----------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I have read an audio track several times, written to various
files, and then compared the files. Unfortunately I notice that the
files are completely different, although the audio data sounds fine.
Surely this is not normal - I thought that the data is stored @{B}digitally@{UB}
-- the files ought to be @{B}identical@{UB}!

@{B}Answer:@{UB} It is true that the data is stored in digital form. Even so, it
is difficult for your CD player, your CD-ROM drive and your CD-burner
to control an @{B}audio@{UB} track with exact precision. Even the better CD-ROM
drives do not always begin reading an audio track at exactly the same
byte. The result is that the bytes in the two image files are slightly
out of synch (for example, the TEAC CD516S V1.0D tends to vary between
20 to 100 bytes). A byte comparison of such image files will leave the
impression that the files differ greatly from one another - in reality,
there are merely slightly out of synch by a small number of bytes. One
second of music corresponds to 176400 bytes. So, if the drive starts
reading 100 bytes too late, you are actually losing a mere 0.0006
seconds of music.

Since there are on error reports and correction for audio data, it is
certainly possible that differing data is transferred from time to
time, especially if the medium is not of the highest quality. Whether
these disturbances are extreme or not very much depends on your CD-ROM
drive. Some CD-ROM drives are very good at reading scratched CDs, while
others will transfer corrupted data.

@{B}Start of song missing
---------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} When reading audio data I notice that some songs are missing
the start of a track -- perhaps half a second. This is not noticeable
with some songs, but is very annoying with others.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} The problem lies with your CD-ROM drive or CD-burner. Some
CD-burners (e.g. Yamaha CDR 100/102 and Philips CDD 2600) start reading
audio data in the wrong place if the pregap of the first track has an
unusually high value. You can recognize this if the first track does
not being at block 0, but, for example, block 33. Drives which exhibit
this problem start reading the first block too late (and will continue
reading a little beyond the last block).

You can get round this problem by modifying the start block for audio
data in the MakeCD settings. Enter the number of the first block of the
first track on the audio CD and you should get the full song. So, if
the first track starts at block 32, enter `32'.

Please bear in mind that this change will only affect those tracks that
you select @{B}after@{UB} changing the setting. If you have already selected the
tracks, you need to select them all over again, since the block numbers
are automatically corrected when choosing the tracks and not when the
tracks are first read.

@{B}Too slow reading audio CDs
--------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} If I copy an audio CD, the data stream breaks off after a
while. My 8x CD-ROM drive is evidently not fast enough, even though my
burner writes at double speed only. What is going on here?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} First, check which speed you have set for reading audio data .
Try setting `0' for `maximum speed'.

Many CD-ROM drives reads CDDA data at single speed only. When copying
an audio track, you should set your CD-burner back to single speed --
or use temporary files.

Some SCSI host adapters (e.g. Oktagon2008 v6.8) cannot transfer certain
block sizes at full speed ((e. g. block sizes that are not to the power
of 2 or are not a multiple of 256 bytes). Oktagon informed us that it
would only transfer at about 230 kB/s. A CD-ROM drive that reads at
double speed needs the audio data to arrive at about 345 kB/s.

The cure here is Oktopussy, a new device driver for the Oktagon from
Oliver Kastl.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} CD players recognize only those tracks contained in the first

@{B}Answer:@{UB} It seems as though you burnt a Multivolume CD. You need a file
system that supports Multivolume. Read the chapter on Multivolume.

Alternatively, if your file system supports Multisession, you can burn
a third track which integrates the contents of first and second tracks.
Read through the chapter on creating an ISO image and pay particular
attention to the cycle gadget. You should record all the tracks that
you want to be visible into the image. So long as you do not add new
data to the track, it will be very short. You may wish to add sensible

the new rearranged icons and the previous tracks. In this way, the
icons of the previous tracks are overwritten with the icons from the

@{B}Question:@{UB} I have an A3000 (scsi.device V40.12) and a Yamaha CDR 100.
MakeCD works brilliantly. I have no problems at all. The Yahama seems
to be a very good burner! However, my file system us unable to mount

seems weird!

@{B}Answer:@{UB} We tested the same configuration and experienced the same
problem. The Yamaha CDR 100 is indeed a very good burner and is not to
blame for this problem. The scsi.device has problems controlling the
burner with the trackdisk command. It is possible that the same problem
will arise with the A2091 and other Commodore host adapters. We were
able to solve the problem on the A3000 by installing the new V34
scsi.device.

If you do not want to install scsi.device V34, use a file system that
employs SCSI-direct commands. AmiCDFS (shareware) would be a good
choice. In any case, make sure that the file system uses SCSI commands
(check the documentation for your file system). Then, everything should

@{B}Answer:@{UB} We always use `cdromemu.device', which can be downloaded from
our Homepage. This should be included with AmiCD-ROM v1.15 too. You
need to copy the mountlist entry for your CD-ROM drive and enter the
device as Device `cdromemu.device' and Unit 0. You may need to put your
CD-ROM file system in trackdisk mode. For details on how to do that,
please check the instructions for the file system, or ask the person
whom supplied you with the CD-ROM file system, or ask the author of the
file system.

We were unable to get `BabelCDROMFS' running with `cdromemu.device'.
Incidentally, the trick with `cdromemu.device' will only work if the
image for an empty CD-R was created. So it is not possible to test
MultiVolume or MultiSession images in advance. In addition, the image
file must have a block size of 2048. Raw data (e.g. Mode2 image files)
cannot be tested with `cdromemu.device'

@{B}Answer:@{UB} There are two possibilities: either your CD-ROM file system is
not working properly (try a different CD-ROM file system), or your
drive has a problem with multisession CDs containing too many sessions.
These drives stop reading the CD from a certain session. Unfortunately
there is little we can recommend here -- aside from purchasing a new
drive. We have good results with the TEAC CD516: the TEAC recognized
and correctly read all sessions on a CD-R that has problems when used
with a Toshiba drive or CD-burner.

@{B}Multivolume errors
------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I would like to make a multivolume CD by copying the data
tracks from several fairly empty CDs onto a single CD-R. I have tried
this by reading the tracks from the source CDs and then copying them
one after the other to the CD-R, fixing the session each time --
anyway, I have tried twice without success - both times, only the first
track can be read. What am I doing wrong?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} Each multisession track or multivolume track that is @{B}not@{UB} the
very first track on the CD-R must be specially made since the data
track is different -- according to which block the track starts on the
CD-R. Tracks set to base block 0 cannot be written to another position
on the CD-R. MakeCD warns about this from V2.0 or higher - previous
versions gave no warning (base blocks were not even supported then).

@{B}Back-up CDs
-----------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} How do I make back-up copies of my mixed CDs (several tracks
and Mode2) in Track-At-Once (TAO) mode?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} The audio for one of the settings must be entered as Start 0
blocks and Pause 152 blocks. Back in the main window you can add the
complete CD via the menu. When required (if the performance is not
sufficient), you can turn on temporary images and write the CD.

You can use these settings to copy most, but not all, CDs successfully.

For 100% one-to-one copies you need the Disc-At-Once version of
MakeCD. That said, the method above is fine for most copies.

You must of course abide by the licence conditions of the CDs that you
want to copy, otherwise you could be breaking the law.

@{B}Back-up CD Extra CDs
--------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I would like to copy a CD which has several audio tracks
followed by one data track. The length reported by MakeCD for the last
audio track is too large and MakeCD fails when trying to read it.  What
can be done about this?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} The disc in question is a so called "CD Extra". This CDs have
two sessions: The audio tracks are part of the first session and the
data track is "hidden" from CD players in the second one.

MakeCD is not able to write two session in one go right now, so you
have to fiddle a bit to get a correct copy. You might also use DAO and
allow MakeCD to pad the last audio tracks with zero as soon as the
error requester pops up, but this way all tracks end up in one session.
Make sure your CD player and filesystem can handle this!

The other way to copy it is by writing the first session so that it has
the correct length and the data track can be written to the second
session without changing its startblock. Setup and write like this:

   · "Copy CD" with write mode DAO or (if you haven't registered DAO or
     your writer does not support session fixation in DAO -- see drive
     feature list) with TAO and exact track starts.

   · "Setup Project"

   · Remove the data track.

   · Edit the last audio track: if your source drive reported the wrong
     length, then shorten the track by 11250 (DAO) or 11175 (TAO)
     blocks. This can be done either with the source track requester or
     (in expert mode) in the source length gadget directly. If your
     source drive is a writer it may report a correct length and you
     can leave the length as it is, but you have to set the track pause
     to zero instead.

   · Write the project with session fixation.

   · Clear the project, add one track and select the data track as
     source.

   · Write the track to the next session with CD-R fixation (if you
     want an exact copy) or session fixation (if there is plenty of
     space you could add more data).

This has been tested, but no guarantee can be given that the block
numbers given above are suitable for all drives! In this case MakeCD
will issue a warning that the data track should not be written to the
disc because the start block does not match. Then you might retry with
a new disc and change the length of the audio track so that it matches
this time (MakeCD tells you the difference in warning requester), or
you could remaster the data track: mount a filesystem on the source
disc, select it as source for ISO image creation and write this to the
second session.  This won't give you an exact copy, but all the files
will be copied and unless different ISO options were used, the copy
should be as good as the source.

@{B}Speed problem
-------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I have tried copying a CD to a CD-R. I read from the CD-ROM
drive and wrote directly to the CD-burner, i.e. without using temporary
files. My CD-ROM drive reads at double speed and my CD-burner writes at
quad speed. Suddenly, the speed of the CD-ROM drive falls dramatically
and the buffer empties out. Another saucer.:-( Please repair this.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} We cannot repair this. CD-ROM drives often reduce their speed
when they encounter a scratched surface that has to be read. Once the
scratch has been passed, many drives then speed up again, while others
stay at the reduced speed. The latter is probably what is happening in
your case. You could try a firmware update for your drive. If that
doesn't help, try temporary files for scratched CDs. It may also help
to reduce the write speed.

@{B}Question:@{UB} What are CD-RW drives? Something to do with CD burners?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} CD-RW drives are CD burners, but they can also write to the new
CD-RW media. CD-RW discs are special CD-Rs. They are more expensive but
can be rewritten up to 1000 times -- but you do need a CD-RW drive to
use them. CD-RWs cannot be read by drives built prior to 1997. If your
drive was built later, it may possibly be able to read CD-RWs.

The reflectivity of pressed CDs is about 70%. The value for CD-Rs is
about 65%. For CD-RWs, the reflectivity is only 15%. This should make
it clear why CD-RWs cannot be read on the older conventional drives.

@{B}Optimal burn speed
------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} Is it true that always burning at single speed gives the best
results?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} That is not quite true. What is true, is that the results
depend on the CD burner that you use, the medium used, the burning
speed, and not least of all, the firmware version of the burner.

It was as late as June 1997 that the `Orange Book' was adapted to
four-speed drives. Prior to that, there were only specifications up to
and including double-speed. However, there have been burners that can
write at four-speed some time before the adaptation.

The burning of a tiny whole in a CD-R is not a linear process. It is
not a simple case of burning with twice the intensity for half the
period of time. In addition, the medium plays a part with regards to
the time and intensity needed to burn a hole. Hence, before the CD
burner starts writing a track, it burns a test pattern in a reserved
area on the CD to calibrate the laser and speed. Even this process does
not always guarantee optimal results.

To summarize, you can sometimes get the best results with single speed.
However, it is possible that you will get the worst results at
single-speed, because the CD burner is not optimized for it. Some
experts recommend that you burn at the maximum speed if possible, since
the drive has been optimized for this speed.

of whether I write this to the hard drive as an image or send it
directly to the CD burner, the process is terribly slow. Can't you
optimize? My processor is normally very fast and my system has plenty
of memory.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} MakeCD is already highly optimized! We have heard of similar
problems before. In all cases the problem was due to a configuration
error for the MASK value in HDToolBox.

Take the following steps. Please note, we accept @{B}no@{UB} responsibility for
this process, such as damage to the RigidDiskBlock. You undertake this
at your own risk. If you destroy your RDB, don't format the whole disk.
First, try Angela's RDB-Salv
(`http://home.pages.de/~Angela/rdbsalv.html'). RDB-Salv can often
recover lost AmigaDOS partitions!

  1. Run HDToolBox

  2. Select the drive which contains the partition where the image
     should be created.

  3. Click on `Partition Drive'.

  4. Click on `Advanced Options'.

  5. Select the partition where you read the data from.

  6. Click on `Change ...'.

  7. You now see `Mask'. Perhaps you have `0xfffff?', where `?' is
     usually `c', `e' or `f' Add two `f''s to the fnf `f' (e. g.
     `0xfffffffc') and save everything.

  8. Quit HDToolBox and reboot your AMIGA.


Try to create an image again on the partition that you have just
edited. If this has speeded things up, repeat the process for the other
partitions!

@{B}Question:@{UB} Is it possible to burn a CD in several goes? For example, I

@{B}Answer:@{UB} Yes, in Track-At-Once-Mode the burning process can be
interrupted for any length of time after the burning of each track. In
addition, you are also able to take the CD-R out of the drive. You can
even finish the CD-R in a completely different CD-burner. MakeCD
automatically takes care of this for you. All the same, you should make
sure that MakeCD does not fix the session without your explicit wish,
since a CD player will only find the audio tracks contained in the
first session, which in this case would not be your intention. So, make
sure that you turn off automatic fixing!

@{B}CD-R Size
---------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} Today I am standing in front of a shelf with various 74
minute CD-Rs. Should I purchase the CD-Rs with 780 MB or the CD-Rs with
650 MB? Actually, I would like to pack as much information onto the CD
as possible, but provided that 780 MB CD-Rs are at least as good as 650
MB CD-Rs. Can I buy the 780 MB CD-Rs with confidence?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} You have fallen for a marketing ploy. 74 minutes are 74
minutes, that cannot be disputed. Both CD-Rs, however, store about the
same amount of data. You will, of course, ask why the MB statements do
not agree. This is quite simple: 330,000 blocks fir on a 74 minute
CD-R. If you write 330,000 blocks to the CD-R, you end up with
330,000*2.048 bytes, i.e. 681,984,000 bytes (650 MB). Some firms state
the capacity as 680 MB for marketing reasons (where 'M' no longer
stands for "mega", but "million"). If you then fill the 330,00 blocks
of the CD-R with music data, you end up with 330,000*2.352 bytes, i.e.
783,216,000 bytes (746 MB), since music data does not require bytes for
the sector header, ECCs or EDCs. To work the figures as much as
possible, some firms then state the capacity as 780 MB or 783 MB.

In conclusion, one can say that 650 MB, 680 MB, 750 MB and 780 MB CD-Rs
all have the same storage capacity!

@{B}N-times speed
-------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} What does two-speed or 4-speed mean?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} Single-speed is the speed with which a CD plays in a
conventional music CD player. The speed rating refers to the maximum
transfer rate of the drive. For each number, multiply by 150 kB/s to
calculate this.

E.g. two-speed = 2*150 = 300 kB/s E.g. eight-speed = 8*150 = 1.2 MB/s

Note: this speed is the maximum transfer rate. Much time will be added
on when jumping to new positions on the disc. If you are copying many
files, expect the average transfer rate to be significantly lower.
Also, the speed of your SCSI bus could be a bottleneck. If your SCSI
interface supports a maximum transfer rate of 1.5 MB/s, don't expect a
32-speed drive to exceed this value!

     smokes has told us that he has burnt the first half of a CD with a
     dirty lens and the second half with a cleaned lens. The difference
     on the CD-R was @{B}clearly visible@{UB} -- and CD-Rs burnt with the
     cleaned lens worked properly again. Similar problems can also be
     experienced by non-smokers -- e.g. through candles or dust (e.g.
     open fire).

  6. Try connecting your CD-burner to another mains adapter. One user
     has @{B}enormous@{UB} problems with his brand new Yamaha CDR 200, used with
     an (AMIGA and a PC. Fixing often failed and the written tracks
     could not be read in many drives. He was using a PC mains adapter
     for the CD-burner. He tried the burner with the A3000 mains
     adapter, and suddenly everything started working perfectly --
     similar to a cleaned lens (see above). There was presumably a
     defect with his PC mains adapter. A similar fault is also
     imaginable if the mains adapter is overloaded. The nasty thing
     about this was that it was not obvious that the mains adapter was
     at fault - the burner was obviously getting power and was even
     burning. So this is always worth bearing in mind.

  7. You can clean your burner @{B}at your own risk@{UB}. Dust clusters can
     sometimes block the mechanism so that the laser can no longer move
     freely on the carriage. This can produce peculiar results.
     Cleaning (and perhaps oiling the mechanism with a suitable
     lubricant) often helps. The authors of MakeCD have @{B}not@{UB} tried this
     and are unable to help. Do not try this if you are unsure, and
     remember, it is at your own risk.

@{B}Transfer rate
-------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} The transfer rate for my CD-ROM drive is faster than it
should be - or at least it appears to be. MakeCD's write window shows a
very high transfer rate for the drive. Why?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} MakeCD shows the interval between sending a read request to the
CD-ROM drive and receiving back the request together with the data.
That is all. Some drives use intelligent buffer technology while
MakeCD is not using the drive to fill its buffer with data that it
hopes will be requested on the next access to the drive. The drive
often "guesses" correctly and the drive is able to send the data
directly from its buffer to MakeCD without even having to access the
CD. This is why the drive appears to be so fast. Without the small
pauses, the value would be slower.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} To be honest, we, the authors, turn absolutely nothing off when
burning a CD. Our screen blanker continues to run and does not
interfere. Sometimes we type in texts during burning -- without any
problems.

It only becomes critical if a program crashes (so only use @{B}stable@{UB}

@{B}CD-ROM drive recommendation
---------------------------@{UB}

@{B}Question:@{UB} I am planing to buy a new CD-ROM drive. Any tips?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} Angela has a TEAC CD516S (SCSI), which also has an ATAPI
version, and she is very satisfied with it. The drive should
theoretically read at 16 speed - on the A3000 we could only measure 12
speed. But the drive has a number of advantages:

   · Reliable reading of audio data (CDDA). There were no noticeable
     differences in the CDDA files on the A3000 when reading at quad
     speed, with the exception of being a few bytes out of synch (which
     is to be expected). When reading at 8 speed, there were a few
     @{B}small@{UB} inaudible changes every million bytes or so.

   · Excellent error correction. Even scratched CDs read well. Angela
     could read CD-Rs that were completely unreadable in other drives.

   · No detectable reselection problems, even though the A3000 is very
     susceptible to these!

   · Quiet -- the drive is supposedly quieter than most other 16-speed
     drives, although we have not been able to compare the noise to
     other 16-speed drives.

   · FlashROM -- the firmware can be updated with the help of a PC
     should the need arise.

   · drawer technology, so caddies are not required.

These tests were carried out with a TEAC CD516S, firmware version 1.0D.
The firmware version 1.0g is reputedly even better and resolves a few
problems. e.g. firmware version 1.0D swaps the audio channels of the
TEAC, but this has been resolved in firmware version 1.0g. Therefore we
recommend updating to 1.0g.

Note: the new version of this drive, the TEAC CD532, is supposed to be
good too.

@{B}Question:@{UB} When are you going to support my CD-burner XYZ?

@{B}Answer:@{UB} It is not easy to support all the different makes of CD-burner,
because there is no SCSI command set which has been implemented for all
CD-burners! Try our MCC driver for modern CD-burners. If this driver
doesn't work, try the other drivers. If none of the drivers work, we
need the programming docs for your CD-burner and often a loan unit for
this version. Check `doc/Compatibility' to see if support is already

@{B}Question:@{UB} I have installed MakeCD. I can run the program, but the
moment I try to burn (or read data from the CD-ROM drive), I keep
getting a strange error message -- even though my burner (or CD-ROM
drive) is supported. Help!!!

@{B}Answer:@{UB} Are you sure that you have set the correct MakeCD driver for
your CD burner (or CD-ROM drive)? Please consult the compatibility list
(`doc/Compatibility') to check which driver your CD-ROM drive needs.
Then, set this driver for the drive. MakeCD automatically selects the
correct driver for most CD burners. CD-ROM drives are not as commonly
recognized as burners since there are many more types to chose from.

The automatic recognition may fall for the following reasons:

   · You did not have the driver installed during the installation
     process. Cure? Install the correct driver! (See
     `doc/Compatibility'.)

   · The drive is not very common and the name is not recognized.
     Cure: select the appropriate driver in the drive selection window.
     Then, tell us the name that MakeCD shows for the drive in the
     Settings window. We need exact details and the name of the driver
     that works for the drive. We can then have the drive automatically
     recognized in the next version of MakeCD. Please send your report
     to: `patrick@core.de'.

   · If your drive will not transfer CDDA data, perhaps your drive
     does not support CDDA. Cure: by a CD-ROM drive that does support
     CDDA, or read the data using the burner and burn indirectly by
     means of an image file.

@{B}Answer:@{UB} The table of contents (TOC) of a CD only saves where the CD
tracks @{B}begin@{UB}, not where they @{B}stop@{UB} or how long they are.

On reading a CDs table of contents (TOC), MakeCD attempts to strip the
pause after a track from the length of the track. For technical
reasons, this only works if the pause after the data track is not
unusually long and if the CD shows no read errors at the end of the
track (e. g. through scratches).

If the method used to determine the track length fails, you can either
reduce the track length before reading, or ignore the error by
selecting "Use File" in the error requester.

@{B}Glossary
********@{UB}

Access Time
     The "access time" is the time required to access a certain piece
     of information. For CD-ROM drives, the maximum access time is the
     time it takes for the read head to move from one end of the drive
     to the other end.

AIFF
     "AIFF" stands for "Audio Interchange File Format"; Created by
     Apple as a standard file format for saving sound files of any type.

Block
     In CD terminology, a "block" corresponds to a "sector". See
     "Sector".

Blue Book
     The "Blue Book" describes the CD EXTRA format.

Bug Report
     Almost all useful programs contain bugs. The complexity of
     programs makes it almost impossible to write error-free code. If
     you encounter bugs in MakeCD, please send us a "bug report".
     Please describe the bug as accurately as possible, including a
     "recipe" for reproducing the error. Be sure to document the @{B}exact@{UB}
     version number of MakeCD that you are using. Also, please state
     your @{B}precise@{UB} system details.

Caddy
     A "caddy" is a cover for CDs used by @{B}some@{UB} CD-ROM drives or CD
     writers. The caddy is usually made of plastic or metal and you
     insert the caddy directly into the drive, the idea being to reduce
     the scratching of CD disks -- this only works in practice if each
     CD has its own caddy.

     Caddies are of no use if you use a tray-loaded drive.

CD
     A "CD" is a storage medium that can save information. Think of a
     CD as a write-protected floppy disk with a massive storage
     capacity. Whereas floppy disks and hard drives normally use the
     AMIGA Filing System (OFS or FFS), CDs use a format known as ISO
     9660. ISO 9660 is extremely popular -- files on ISO 9660 CDs can
     be read on almost any computer system.

CD-DA
     "CD-DA" stands for "Compact Disc Digital Audio".

     Philips and Sony introduced CD-DA in October 1982, making it
     possible to record and save music digitally. The "compact disc"
     ("CD") was introduced along with CD-DA - see "Red Book".

CD Extra
     See "Enhanced Music CD".

CD-i
     "CD-i" stands for "Compact Disc Interactive", a computer system
     developed by Philips for multimedia applications (real-time
     animations, video and sound). The CD-i format is defined in the
     Green Book.

CD Plus
     See "Enhanced Music CD".

CD-R
     "CD-R" stands for CD Recordable. These are special compact discs
     (also known as "gold disks" due to their colour) which can record
     data by using a special laser (in a CD writer) that "burns"
     microscopic holes into the recording layer. These pits can then be
     read by standard CD readers. CD-Rs are more fragile than standard
     CDs (the label side is particularly delicate) so extra care should
     be taken in their storage and handling. The recordable side is
     usually gold, green or blue in colour. The non-recordable side is
     often covered with some kind of label. Without a label, some
     people inevitably insert the CD-R upside down.

     The surface above the reflective layer is very thin. This makes
     CD-Rs quite sensitive to scratches on the top side of the CD.
     Please bear this in mind when you label the CD - avoid using sharp
     nibs or markers containing solvents.

CD-ROM
     "CD-ROM" stands for "Compact Disc Read Only Memory". This is a CD
     based on a standard for saving digital data to a CD. In contrast
     to CD-DA, less data is saved on the CD-ROM. The seemingly unused
     space is actually used for error correction codes. This coding is
     extremely important for data reliability.

CD-ROM Drive
     A "CD-ROM drive" is a device that can be attached to a computer to
     allow CD-ROMs to be read or played. In order to play music CDs,
     you normally require amplified speakers or headphones - these are
     usually attached to the CD-ROM drive rather than to the computer
     itself.

CD-ROM Image
     CD-ROMs, as well as floppy disks, hard disks or individual
     partitions, can be written as a single file. In the case of a
     CD-ROM, the image file is created by writing all the blocks to the
     file, beginning at block 0 and ending with the highest block
     number. When the file is written back to a CD-R, a CD-ROM is
     created which contains exactly the same data as the original
     CD-ROM. In principle, the CD-ROM has been copied.

     If you want to save data from a hard drive to a CD, you @{B}cannot@{UB}
     simply save the image of the hard drive to the CD-R. Instead you
     must use MakeCD to create an image derived from the directory or
     directories - this image can then be written to the CD-R.

CD-ROM-XA
     The "XA" of "CD-ROM-XA" stands for "Extended Architecture".
     CD-ROM-XA is an extension of the "Yellow Book" standard. XA tracks
     can contain audio and video data and are suited to multimedia
     applications. CD-ROM-XA is commonly used for photo CDs.

CD-RW
     "CD-RW" stands for Compact Disc ReWritable. This type of compact
     disc can be written to up to 1000 times.

CD-WO
     "WO" stands for Compact Disc Write Once. See "CD-R".

Coaster
     A "coaster" is a damaged CD-R(W). Coasters are totally useless for
     data, but some people find artistic uses for them!

Coffee Break
     A coffee break is the amount of time a program requires to do a
     particular task in the background. The idea is that you go and
     have a cup of coffee while the task is running. Sometimes you'll
     barely have time to get to the kettle, another time you'll be able
     to bake a cake to go with the coffee...

     My sincere apologies to those of you familiar with "Meeting
     Pearls III" who thought "coffee break" meant @{B}one@{UB} cup of coffee. ;-)

Compact Disc
     See "CD".

DAE
     "DAE" stands for "Digital Audio Extraction". Audio data is read
     from a music CD and is passed on to the computer. The audio data
     can then be processed by the computer.

@{B}     Please note: not all CD-ROM drives support "DAE"@{UB}!

DAO (Disc-At-Once)
     "DAO" stands for "Disc-At-Once". This is a method for burning a
     CD-R. With "Disc-At-Once", one or several tracks are written
     directly in one piece (without a pause). The CD-R is fixed once
     the track or tracks have been written. "Disc-At-Once" enables you
     to make a 100% identical copy of a CD. It also enables you to make
     music CDs without a pause between tracks.

Device Driver
     Your AMIGA uses "device drivers" to communicate with devices such
     as hard drives or CD writers. Among other things, this driver is
     used to read data from the CD burner or to write data to it.
     Device drivers use the file suffix `.device'. For example:
     `scsi.device', `gvpscsi.device', `omniscsi.device',
     `z3scsi.device', `dracoscsi.device', `squirrelscsi.device',
     `squirrelserial.device' etc.

Enhanced Music CD
     Also called "CD EXTRA" and formerly known as "CD Plus". This is
     the standard for interactive CDs defined in the Blue Book. These
     discs consist of two sessions. The first session contains pure
     audio tracks, the second session is data in a restricted format
     (normally MPEG pictures). If a CD EXTRA disc is inserted into a
     standard audio CD player, only the audio tracks are visible.

Green Book
     Describes the details of the CD-i format. See "CD-i".

HFS
     "HFS" stands for the Hierarchical File System, the standard
     Macinstosh file system. HSF does not conform to the ISO standard
     due to the unique data fork and resource fork structure of Mac
     files as well as the support for long file names. MakeCD cannot
     write CDs in the HSF format. There seems little point in adding
     HSF support, since Macs can read standard ISO 9660 discs.

High Sierra Format
     The "High Sierra Format" is the file system originally designed
     for saving data to CD-ROMs. It was short-lived, being superseded
     by "ISO 9660".

Hybrid
     "Hybrid" has two different meanings with regards to CDs:

       1. In the "Orange Book", a "hybrid" is a CD-R with one or more
          sessions saved. However, the CD-R is not fixed -- data can
          still be written to the CD-R.

       2. The word "hybrid" is increasingly used to refer to a CD that
          contains data in both the "HFS format" and in the  "ISO 9660
          format". With hybrid CDs, the HSF files are usually visible
          on the Macintosh, whereas other systems see the ISO 9660
          files. Some AMIGA file systems show the HFS files too.


Image File
     An "image file" is a single file containing all the data to be
     written to the CD. The file contains the data in the exact form
     that will be written to the CD.

ISO 9660
     "ISO 9660" is a standard for cross-platform CD-ROMs. Discs created
     in this format can be read by many operating systems, including
     Amiga, CD32, Macintosh, MS-DOS, Windows and Unix.

ISO 9660 Amiga
     The ISO restrictions are not suitable for the AMIGA. Under the ISO
     definitions, the filename would require a dot, which means that
     the AMIGA icon file would contain two dots (as it consists of the
     filename and the suffix ".info"). However, two dots do not comply
     with the ISO restrictions... So it is common practice for Amiga
     users to discard the restrictions and use filenames at will. Thus,
     MakeCD offers an option called "ISO 9660m Amiga" which uses the
     filenames as stored on your hard disk.

ISO 9660 Level 1
     "ISO 9660 Level 1" does not support long filenames, just the old
     8+3 style (FILENAME.EXT). The dot must be present and at least one
     character, either before or after the dot, is required.
     Furthermore, filenames can contain only capitals, numerals and the
     underscore character.

ISO 9660 Level 2
     "ISO 9660 Level 2" is more flexible than "ISO 9660 Level 1": it
     allows up to 31 characters including the dot. The other
     restrictions for level 1 still apply: only one dot can be used and
     lowercase letters are not permitted.

ISO 9660 Level 3
     "ISO 9660 Level 3" has none of the restrictions present in "ISO
     9660 Level 1" and "ISO 9660 Level 2".

ISRC
     "ISRC" stands for "International Standard Recording Code" and is a
     standard for cross-platform CD-ROMs. Discs created in this format
     can be read by many operating systems, including Amiga, CD32,
     Macintosh, MS-DOS, Windows and Unix.

Joliet
     The Microsoft "Joliet" File System is an expansion of the ISO 9660
     standard and was designed to overcome the filename restrictions of
     "ISO 9660". Joliet permits long filenames and filenames containing
     characters from international character sets.

Lead-in
     The "lead-in" is the area at the start of every section on a CD-R.
     The lead-in remains empty until the session or the CD-R is fixed.
     During fixing, the table of contents (TOC) is written to the
     lead-in. The lead-in occupies 4500 sectors, which equates to one
     minute or about 9MB.

Lead-out
     The area at the end of a session is referred to as the "lead-out".
     The lead-out simply marks out the end of the session. The lead-out
     for the first session requires 6750 sectors, which is
     one-and-a-half minutes or about 13MB. Lead-outs for the subsequent
     sessions take up less space: 2250 seconds, which is half a minute
     or about 4MB.

Meeting Pearls
     "Meeting Pearls" is Germany's favourite CD series. If you have
     internet access, you can access the Meeting Pearls homepage at:

     www.core.de/mp/

Mixed Mode CD
     A "Mixed Mode CD" is a CD containing a data track as well as audio
     tracks. The data track is the first track on the CD. It is then
     followed by one or more audio tracks.

mkisofs
     A program from the unix community used to create "CD-ROM images".

Multisession
     "Multisession" means that a CD consists of information written in
     multiple sessions, each recorded at a different time. The sessions
     are linked together in such a way that only one logical device
     appears when the CD is mounted. Not all CD writers can record this
     type of CD, and not all CD readers can read them.

Multivolume
     "Multivolume" means that a CD consists of multiple sessions, each
     recorded at a different time. However, unlike multisession CDs,
     all the sessions are completely independent of one another so that
     when the CD is mounted each session appears as an individual
     logical name. Not all CD writers can record this type of CD, and
     not all CD readers can read them.

OPC Area
     "OPC Area" stands for "Optimum Calibration Area". This is a
     special area on the CD-R, close to the inner edge.

     A CD writer needs to test the CD-R material before burning a track
     in order to establish the optimum strength for the laser beam. The
     testing takes place in the OPA, which allows for up to 99 tests.

Orange Book
     "Orange Book" describes the details of the CD-R (recordable
     compact disc) standard developed by Sony and Philips.

Packet Writing
     "Track-at-once" has a maximum of 99 tracks per CD. Packet writing
     is a special method allowing several writes per track with minimal
     overhead (7 blocks per write). However, not all CD-ROM drives can
     read CD-Rs created using this method.

PCA
     The "PCA" or "Power Calibration Area" is an area towards the
     centre of the disc used for fine-tuning the laser.

PhotoCD
     "PhotoCD" is a standard based on the "CD-ROM XA", "ISO 9660" and
     Hybrid specifications in the "Orange Book". It allows photos to be
     saved to a CD-R.

PMA
     The "PMA" or "Program Memory Area" is an area on the CD-R
     containing information about where individual tracks start and
     end. The PMA is used by CD writers only. Some of this data is
     written to the "lead-in" of the current session upon the fixation
     of the session or the CD-. This enables normal CD-ROM drives to
     find the tracks. MakeCD always tries to read in the PMA if you are
     using a CD writer. This is because the PMC, in contrast to the
     lead-in, contains details on the exact length of the tracks.

PostGap
     The "PostGap" is 75 sectors in size and must be written after a
     track when the next track is a different type (e. g. data/audio).

PreGap
     The "PreGap" is an area written @{B}before@{UB} a new track. The PreGap
     separates the track from the preceding track and also stores
     further information for certain track types. The PreGap usually
     takes up 150 blocks (2 seconds).

Progress Indicator
     The "progress indicator" informs you how much of the process has
     been completed. The movement of the indicator can be jerky under
     certain conditions. This is the case if the length for the
     operation could not be calculated before the process was started.
     Also, the processor may be overflow so that it simply does not
     have time to redraw the indicator rapidly enough.

Red Book
     The "Red Book" describes the details of the original CD-DA
     (Compact Disc Digital Audio) standard developed by Sony and
     Philips.

Rock Ridge Extensions
     "Rock Ridge extensions" extend on the ISO-9660 standard.

     Among other things, Rock Ridge supports long, mixed-case
     filenames. The files can also be read with file systems that do
     not support Rock Ridge, although the long forms of the filenames
     will not be shown.

     Angela Schmidt has teamed up with other AMIGA programmers to
     develop an AMIGA standard which allows AMIGA attributes
     (protection bits and file comments) to be saved for every single
     object on the CD-ROM. MakeCD supports these special Rock Ridge
     extensions.

     We recommend that you use Rock Ridge extensions.

Romeo
     "Romeo" is a file system format which allows filenames of up to 128
     characters in length. However, international characters are @{B}not@{UB}
     supported.

Run-in/Run-out Blocks
     When the laser is turned on or off, 5 "run-in" or 2 "run-out"
     blocks are written. For technical reasons, these blocks @{B}must@{UB} be
     written.

SCSI ID Number
     So that SCSI devices can communicate together without conflict,
     each device must have its own unique identification number (its
     SCSI ID). This is usually a number between 0 and 6, allowing up to
     7 devices to be connected on your SCSI chain.

     SCSI peripherals will normally have an ID selector on the outside
     of the case; this will be a display that indicates the current ID
     number and a push or rotary switch that allows you to change the
     number. Simply ensure that all the devices in your SCSI chain have
     different ID numbers. If you cannot see an ID selector, consult
     your user manual or contact the dealer that supplied your
     peripheral.

Sector
     A sector is the smallest unit that can be written by a CD writer.
     The number of bytes available in the sector depends on the track
     type. For data tracks, this value is 2048 bytes; for audio tracks,
     2352 bytes. There are 75 sectors to a second. This means that 75
     sectors of music data must be written to the CD-R to produce one
     second of music. A 74-minute CD contains 74*60=4440 seconds or
     333000 sectors of audio data.

Session
     A session is a collection of one or more tracks on a CD. Each
     recording procedure generates a session containing all the tracks
     recorded at that time. A CD recorded in multiple recording
     sessions is known as a multisession CD.

     An empty CD-R always contains an open session, the first session.
     At least one track must be written to the session before the
     session or the CD-R can be fixed.

     When a session is fixed, a new session is opened so that further
     data can be added.

     When a CD-R is fixed, a new session is @{B}not@{UB} opened and no further
     data can be written to the CD-R.

     A fixed session always contains one or more tracks. An open
     session cannot contain any tracks.

     A track @{B}cannot@{UB} span several sessions.

TAO
     "TAO" or "Track-At-Once" is the most common way of burning a CD-R.
     The laser can be stopped after each track. In fact, you can even
     take the CD-R out of the CD writer! This is not possible with
     "DAO".

     The disadvantage of TAO is that 152 blocks (about 2 seconds) are
     usually written between tracks. With audio CDs, this leads to a
     two-second pause between songs.

TOC
     The "TOC" ("Table of Contents") contains the number of tracks and
     the start sectors for each track. This information allows you to
     jump to tracks. The TOC contains details for fixed sessions or
     fixed CD-Rs only.

Track
     A track is the smallest logical unit on a CD. A track is a minimum
     of 600 sectors in length and a CD can contain up to 99 tracks.
     There are three types of tracks: audio tracks, CD-ROM tracks and
     XA/CD-i tracks.

     A track is a continuous data area on the CD. With music CDs, each
     song usually has its own track. This makes it easy to select the
     title you want to play: all you need to do is enter the
     corresponding track number.

     When burning a music CD, you should give each title its own track.
     A music CD typically contains 10 to 20 tracks.

     A simple data CD has just one track containing all the files. A
     multisession or multivolume CD has more than one track with data.

     Each session contains one or more tracks. A track @{B}cannot@{UB} span
     several sessions.

Unit
     See "SCSI ID Number".

UPC
     "UPC" stands for "Universal Product Code", a.k.a. "EAN". Some CD
     writers allow you to define a catalogue number (UPC) with 13
     digits. The UPC is written to the "TOC".

Video-CD
     "Video-CD" is used for recording full-motion videos or movies on
     to a CD.

Yellow Book
     The "Yellow Book" describes all the parameters for CD-ROMs.

@{B}Support
*******@{UB}

We work hard to ensure good support for MakeCD. However, starting
with spring/summer 1999, we won't have much time for personal
support, because both of us will be having a job then. We will try to
answer e-mails, but we can't guarantee anything. Phone support or
snail mail support will be no longer available, then. If you can not
accept this, we ask you to order MakeCD at a dealer because they will
continue their support.  If you have internet access, please use
this facility to obtain your updates and support! You might also try
to get support from the MakeCD mailing list.

@{B}MakeCD Updates
==============@{UB}

MakeCD is continually in development. You can find the latest version
of MakeCD, as well as new CD-R drivers etc., on the internet at:
`http://makecd.core.de/'

Alternatively, you can obtain the latest version free of charge (you
pay the postage and packing costs only) from Katrin Schmidt. This offer
is limited to one floppy per order, of course. See registration form.

@{B}Mailing Lists
=============@{UB}

There are three mailing lists for MakeCD. English is the language of
choice for the mailing lists!

`ml-makecd@unix-ag.org'
     For discussions with other MakeCD users. The MakeCD authors read
     these too, especially to answer questions noone else is able to
     respond to. Sometimes the authors will ask the users for opinions
     on a particular new feature, etc.

`ml-makecd-announce@unix-ag.org'
     No discussions, but announcements made by the authors. For
     example, new versions or new drivers are announced here.

`ml-makecd-binaries@unix-ag.org'
     This list sends all new MakeCD binary files (as well as new
     versions of MakeCD) directly to the mailbox of the person entered.
     This is useful for those without access to FTP servers, home pages
     or newer MakeCD archives.

You can make your entry in a list with `"SUBSCRIBE <user@host.domain>"'
at `<listname>-request@unix-ag.org', where `<listname>' stands for the
name of the mailing list, e. g. `ml-makecd-announce'. Do not send these
requests to the lists themselves, i. e. do not forget the `-request' in
the address! Let's take an example: this is how we enter ourselves on
the announcement list with the address `user@my.email.address':

     To: ml-makecd-announce-request@unix-ag.org
     Subject: Something
     
     SUBSCRIBE user@my.email.address

To remove oneself from the list, you send a similar message, but where
`SUBSCRIBE' is replaced with `UNSUBSCRIBE'.

The following message sends further instructions:

     To: listserv@unix-ag.org
     Subject: Something

@{B}Autoren von MakeCD
******************@{UB}

Two people have worked long and hard to bring you MakeCD

EMail to both authors: `makecd@core.de'

Unfortunatly we cannot accept @{B}any registrations per EMail@{UB}.  If you have
any questions regarding registration (e.g. whether your application has
arrived/is being processed), please ring Katrin Schmidt (see
registration form). We both live a long way away from Katrin und
therefore don't know which registrations have been received in the last
days/weeks. Also note that Katrin has @{B}no@{UB} access to EMail.

@{B}Important:@{UB} If you bought MakeCD through a dealer, you can @{B}only@{UB} receive
support from them or the distributor but @{B}not@{UB} from authors named below.
Please try to understand that we earn a lot less from a copy sold
through a dealer than from a normal shareware registration. To make up
this shortcoming, our business partners take it upon themselves provide
support for buyers of the MakeCD package.

Patrick Ohly
     He programs the GUI, all the SCSI stuff (including the CDROM and
     CD writer drivers), and just about everything to do with
     MakeCD, apart from the creation of ISO images. His adddress until
     spring/summer 1999 is:
          Patrick Ohly
          WG E4/5
          Weechstraße 1
          76131 Karlsruhe
          Germany
          
          E-Mail:  patrick@core.de

Angela Schmidt
     She programs the routines to create the ISO images (and everthing
     to do with them), most of the registration window, and the
     installer script. She also organizes the distribution archives and
     writes the documentation. Her address is:
          Angela Schmidt
          Hochstra_e 18
          84424 Isen
          Germany
          
          E-Mail: angela@core.de

Angela has almost no time anymore to answer support questions because in
1998 she has got a job. Patrick will finish his studies in spring or
summer 1999 end then he will be low on time, too. Therefore we want to
let you know that we won't have time to answer support questions then.
Anyway, we will try to answer our EMails but we can't promise anything
and we will no longer be reachable by telephone. If you wish or require
more support, then you should order MakeCD at one of our dealers.  See
@{"Distributors" Link "LCOMP"}.

@{B}Please read the Instructions and the FAQ thoroughly before you attempt
to approach the authors with your problem. Questions and problems that
are covered in the documentation will no longer be answered or tackled
by us in the future. When we receive irritating queries regarding
something explained in the docs, we normally end up replying in a
pretty unfriendly manner. We haven't written all these docs for nothing!@{UB}

If you do have problems with MakeCD, first try using a `clean'
workbench installation (i.e. @{B}no@{UB} extra programs or hacks/patches etc.)
and see if the problem still exists @{B}before@{UB} you contact the authors
please. Otherwise you will receive @{B}no@{UB} support.

If you have problems with your SCSI devices e.g. after clicking on
`Cancel' it takes an eternity waiting for IO to finish and no error
requesters are displayed, please contact your dealer. In this case
either your SCSI host adapter or CD writer are not working as they
should (see FAQ). Unfortunately we cannot help you if this is the case.
If your SCSI bus `hangs' while your CD writer accesses it, you probably
have such a problem.

If, on the other hand, MakeCD displays an error requester, then please
contact us. First enable the `DEBUG' tooltype in the MakeCD icon,
reproduce the error, and send the resulting debug file to Patrick. You
can also use the `Write Logfile' option from the `Project' menu.

Before you contact your dealer our us you should of course always read
our FAQ and compatibility list!
