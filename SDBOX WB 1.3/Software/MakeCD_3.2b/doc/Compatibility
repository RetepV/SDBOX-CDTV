@{B}Compatibility List
******************@{UB}

MakeCD has been carefully tested. This chapter tries to list all CD
writers, CD-ROM drives, CD-Rs and systems, that have been tested and
tells you, if they worked in our tests or in customer's tests or if they
didn't.

If a CD writer or CD-ROM drive is listed as "tested", this does @{B}not@{UB}
mean, that it works on @{B}all@{UB} systems. On some systems, it might block the
SCSI bus or do any other bad things. Therefore, we have added lists of
systems which have been reported as @{"working" Link "CSYSG"} or @{"not working" Link "CSYSB"}. @{B}Read these
lists, too!@{UB}

@{B}How to select the correct driver
================================@{UB}

If MakeCD does not automatically select a driver for your CD-ROM drive
or your CD writer, or if MakeCD shows it as unknown, then read the
following hints from Patrick:

@{I}     MakeCD selects a suitable SCSI driver based on the vendor and
     drive ID of a SCSI or ATAPI drive. If your drive is marked as
     "unknown" this only means that you have to select the correct
     driver manually.

     These are hints to find the correct driver:

        · For CD writers the CDR_SCSI3_ATAPI.driver is usually the
          right choice if it is a modern (MMC compatible) SCSI drive or
          ATAPI drive.

        · The CD_ROM.driver is suitable if you are absolutely sure
          that your CD-ROM does not support CDDA extraction with any of
          the other CD_#?.drivers.

        · The CD_ATAPI.driver should be the right one for all ATAPI
          CD-ROMs, however, not all drives support audio reading (e.g.
          some Mitsumis don't). Please tell us if yours doesn't.

        · The CD_ATAPI.driver might work for new SCSI CD-ROMs, too,
          because the commands used are part of the SCSI 3 standard. So
          if the driver you use at the moment allows CDDA extraction,
          but not speed settting, then you might try CD_ATAPI.driver.

     Sometimes the same driver is able to accomplish something on
     different ways. Alternative ways might be necessary to work around
     problems of specific drives. For most known drives the driver
     already chooses the correct way automatically, but for unknown
     drives or drives with so far unknown bugs you can choose yourself.
     This is done by setting environment variables, e.g. with `setenv
     MAKECD_READ_MODE2_RAW=1' or adding the same string to the
     tooltypes of MakeCD.

     The following options are supported by all or some drivers:

    MAKECD_READ_MODE2_RAW (all drivers)
          Some drives deliver invalid data with block size 2336 (Sony
          928E), others report checksum errors although they shouldn't
          use the checksums (Plextor PX-20TS). In both cases reading
          raw data still works, so MakeCD can read mode 2 tracks raw
          and throw away the unnecessary bytes alternatively.

          This workaround is enabled only for the Sony 928E, but not
          for any other drive, because some drives might read raw data
          slower and the additional processing requires more CPU time.
          On slow computers with fast drives the computer might perhaps
          even appear to be locked.

    MAKECD_UPDATE_EJECT (all drivers)
          Some CD writers remember tracks that have been written in
          test mode even after being asked to update their view of the
          CD-R. This options causes MakeCD to force an update by
          ejecting the disc. Drives with a tray will close it
          automatically, but caddies have to be inserted manually.

    MAKECD_NO_MCN (all drivers)
          Asking some drives to read the Medium Catalog Number didn't
          work and caused locks. If you have problems when setting up a
          copy project or appending a CD that you didn't have with
          MakeCD versions before V3.0 then try this option and also
          disable ISRC reading and index scanning in the MakeCD GUI.

    MAKECD_SONY_PLEXTOR_SPEED_YES, MAKECD_SONY_PLEXTOR_SPEED_NO (CD_Sony_Plextor.driver)
          In V3.2 the Sony and Plextor driver have been merged because
          the only difference was that the Plextor driver could also
          set the speed. The capability of a drive to do that is now
          recognized automatically, but if this test should fail these
          options can be used to enforce or disable speed setting.

    MAKECD_ALLOW_TAO_INDICES (CDR_Philips_2000/2600.driver)
          Setting indices in TAO has caused SCSI problems on some
          systems.  Therefore this feature is now disabled by default.
          If you want to use it again you have to set this option.

    MAKECD_MITSUMI_FIXATE
          Enable a workaround for crashes after fixating a disc with a
          Mistumi ATAPI writer.

    MAKECD_WRITE_MODE2_MIXED_DAO
          Recent Plextor firmware revisions failed to write PSX discs
          correctly in DAO. MakeCD works around this problem by using a
          slightly different data mode. MAKECD_WRITE_MODE2_MIXED_DAO
          enables this mode (which is on by default for the Plextor
          drives) and MAKECD_WRITE_MODE2_MIXED_DAO_NO overrides this
          default (for testing purposes).

    MAKECD_RETRIES
          Can be used to increase the number of automatic retries in
          case of read errors from a CD. The default is 2, because most
          drives do retries themselves already.

     The following options can be used to change some general aspect of
     MakeCD:

    MAKECD_BUF_MEM_TYPE (all drivers)
          You can restrict the memory MakeCD uses for reading and
          writing to a certain type of memory. Use `setenv
          MAKECD_READ_MODE2_RAW=x' with `x' being the decimal
          representation of the memory attributes you want to be
          required. Restricting this is hardly ever necessary.

          It might increase the performance if you have a SCSI
          controller that works faster with certain memory and slower
          with the default memory.  Examples:

             · Amiga 4000, CyberStormPPC (32MB), GVP A2000-HC+8 Series
               II Rev II (4MB) => use MAKECD_BUF_MEM_TYPE=256
               (MEMF_LOCAL)

             · for other GVPs: MAKECD_BUF_MEM_TYPE=512 (MEMF_24BITDMA)
               (unconfirmed)

    MAKECD_PRI_READ, MAKECD_PRI_CONV, MAKECD_PRI_WRITE
          The task priority of read, conversion and write process
          during time critical operations. Default is 6. Changing them
          probably doesn't help much in cases of general system
          performance deficiencies.

     You can help us and other users by telling us your drive's ID, the
     correct SCSI driver for it and any of the workarounds above you
     had to use. MakeCD displays the complete ID in the settings window
     and the device selection requester. If you cannot snap the string
     there, you might also go to these windows, return to the main
     window and save the debug log with the menu item "Project/Write
     logfile...".  It will contain the ID.

     Please write to `patrick@core.de'. Please tell me also if you have
     done tests with other drivers -- otherwise I won't know if e.g. the
     Plextor driver doesn't work while Sony does or if Plextor just
     wasn't tested. Thanks for your help!

@{B}Known problems with MakeCD drivers
----------------------------------@{UB}

There are some known problems with some MakeCD drivers and drives. They
are listed here. Usually, they are not fatal.

Using driver "CDR_JVC_Teac":
     JVC drives (we tested the JVC XR-W2010) @{B}can@{UB} cause a lot of
     trouble. If you own a JVC CD writer, try it and be happy if it
     works, but don't blame us if it does not work.

    `JVC XR-W2010 V1.51':
             · With our first tries, the JVC XR-W2010 didn't work with
               an oktagon.device V6.8 and a omniscsi.device V6.11. It
               always rejected the first write command with an `ILLEGAL
               COMMAND' error.
               This turned out to be a very strange SCSI or heating
               problem. The drive works now when connected to the
               Oktagon with no other device on this SCSI chain.
               Other sources state that our problem might have been
               caused by a not so good media. Hmm...

             · This drive is a very bad CD and CD-R reader. We could
               not even read data or audio tracks, which the drive
               wrote by itself, although they are read well by a Yamaha
               CDR 100 and a Matsushita CD-ROM drive. The JVC XR-W2010
               even produced a lot of read errors with normal (pressed)
               CDs.
               If your drive has the same problem, this will have the
               following consequences:

                 1. Multisession merging often will not work properly,
                    because the previous tracks have to be scanned with
                    the CD writer.

                 2. Mode 2 recognition can fail and therefore XA CD-Rs
                    can be fixed with the wrong TOC type.

                 3. The name of ISO tracks can not always be read.


             · Once we made a test with one very full CD-R, and the
               drive reported a start block which was higher than the
               end block. We wrote another track and both last tracks
               were listed correctly afterwards. Again, we wrote
               another track, and it was listed wrong again -- and
               writing a 4th track fixed the problem again. @{B}Very
               strange.@{UB}
               When we put the same CD-R, which showed the wrong track
               start in the JVC XR-W2010, into a Yamaha CDR 100, it was
               listed correctly. Putting it back to the JVC XR-W2010
               showed wrong values again.
               You cannot fix a CD-R with invalid track starts with the
               JVC XR-W2010.  You have to use either a different CD
               writer or write more tracks and hope that this will fix
               the problem.

Using driver "CDR_Plextor":
    Using device `CDR_Plextor CD-R PX-R24CS V1.50':
    Using device Ricoh RO-1420C:
    Using device Ricoh RS-1420C:
             · Session information may not be read properly depending
               on the firmware version.

Using driver "CDR_Sony":
    Using device `SONY CD-R  CDU926S 1.0a ( Jan23)':
             · The writer seems to be unable to accept buffer chunks
               of more than approx. 240kB. It rejects the write command
               with `ILLEGAL FIELD IN COMMAND DESCRIPTOR'. You have to
               reduce the chunk size in the settings.

             · The writer is not able to write XA tracks with a
               blocksize of 2048 (form 1) or 2328 (form 2). Therefore
               only the general mode 2 type is supported by MakeCD. You
               will be warned and may ignore the warning, but until a
               firmware supports this block sizes the writer will
               reject some commands as illegal.

             · The Sony writer are very accurate regarding CD-ROM
               standards.  You will not be able to write certain track
               types after some others (but you won't want to anyway).
               Example of impossible combinations: Mode 1 (data) + Mode
               2.

             · The writer seems to be unable to simulate fixation. The
               testmode can really be enabled for writing tracks, but
               has no effect on fixation. The CDR_Sony.driver will
               therefore _not_ issue the fixation command if testmode
               is enabled. If other Sony CD writers behave differently,
               tell us.

@{B}Contributing to this list
-------------------------@{UB}

Contributions to this list are welcome.

However, you should test your system carefully, before stating that it
works. You can use the following checklists to do that. Send your test
results to `makecd@core.de'.

@{B}Testing your CD writer
......................@{UB}

If you want to test your CD writer, go through the following steps.
Please do only report tests which are not yet contained in our
compatibility list or which differ from the result that other customers
made. See @{"CD writer test protocol list" Link "CDR_TEST_PROT_LIST"}.

  1. What is the complete name of your CD writer? Have a look at the
     settings window -- when you select your CD writer as target, it
     displays the whole version string. That's what we need.

  2. Driver name. Note the name of the driver which you use for your
     tests, e.g. "CDR_Yamaha_10x". The name is being displayed in the
     settings window.

  3. Table of Contents. Open the Target-CD-R window, using the menu.
        · Does it list all sessions?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

        · Does it list all tracks?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

        · Does it also list tracks of sessions that are not yet fixed?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

  4. Test Mode. Try to write in test mode (in Track-At-Once mode).
        · Was it successfull? (Is there @{B}really no change@{UB} to the CD-R?)
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

  5. Write audio track. Try to write an audio track (in TAO mode)
        · Was it successful and does your CD player play this track?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

        · Did you @{B}really@{UB} write an audio track, or just in test mode?

  6. Write data track. Try to write a data track (in TAO mode)
@{I}          Note, if you have written some audio tracks, you can fix the
          session and then @{B}create@{UB} and write a data track and fix that
          session, too. Your CD will be a perfect audio CD in your CD
          player and if your filesystem supports multisession, it will
          be a perfect data CD in your CD-ROM drive, too. So you need
          only one CD-R for testing.  @{UI}

        · Was it successful?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

          ( ) Really               ( ) Test mode

  7. Fix session/CD-R. Try to fix a session and the CD-R. You have to
     open the window that lists the contents of your CD-R (use the
     menu) in order to do that.
        · Could you successfully fix the session?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

          ( ) Really               ( ) Test mode

  8. DAO tests. If the MakeCD driver that you are using supports DAO,
     do some tests in DAO mode, please.
        · Could you successfully write a data track in raw DAO mode?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

        · Could you successfully write a data track in cooked DAO mode?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

        · Could you successfully write an audio track in DAO mode?

  9. Writing speeds. Use the settings window to set the speed.
        · Can you select the different writing speeds supported by the
          writer?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

 10. If you are using a CD-RW drive, try to erase a CD-RW.
        · Could you successfully format the CD-RW in quick mode?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

        · Could you successfully format the CD-RW in complete mode?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

        · Could you successfully erase the fixation of a session/CD-R?

     have to select the writer as source drive in the settings window.
     Try to read a data track from your CD writer.
        · Could you successfully read this track?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

 13. Try to read an audio track from your CD writer. If you want, you
     can try with MakeCD's play option.
        · Could you successfully read this track?
          ( ) Yes      ( ) No      ( ) Not tested

 14. Your name
        · We would like to note your name (and maybe your email
          address) together with this entry in our compatibility List.
          Please tell us, whether or not we may do this.

@{B}Testing your whole system
.........................@{UB}

If you have a system that runs fine with MakeCD, or a system that causes
SCSI trouble, and if your system is not yet contained in this file, we
are looking forward for your test results in order to include them in
this list. We need the following information:

  1. Your Amiga
     e.g. A3000, A4000, A1000, ...

  2. The OS version you use
     e.g. OS 3.1

  3. Information about your SCSI system in the following form:
     For each SCSI hostadapter which you are using
        · Name of the hostadapter

@{B}CD writers
==========@{UB}

This section is intended to help you find a good CD writer or to find
more information about the CD writer which you already have. We created
a list of all CD writers we have heard of, and collected more detailed
information about a lot of drives. Furthermore, we tested your drives
with a lot of drives and show you the test results.

@{B}Recommended CD writers
----------------------@{UB}

At the moment, we have statements about the following CD writers. Please
don't forget to check if they @{"work" Link "CSYSG"} or @{"don't work" Link "CSYSB"} with your system.

Yamaha CDR 100/102 (recommended)
     These CD writers don't have any known SCSI problems. They are old,
     but known as very reliable drives. People tell, they don't get any
     coasters when using these drives.

Yamaha CDR 200/400 (recommended)
     This is the new generation of Yamaha drives. Since they are not yet
     available for a long time (as of 7/97), we can't tell how long they
     live. But they seem to work reliable and people report they don't
     get any coasters when using these drives.

Yamaha CDR 2260/4260 (recommended)
     This is the CD-RW generation of Yamaha drives. Since they are not
     yet available for a long time, we can't tell how long they live.
     But they seem to work reliable and people report they don't get
     any coasters when using these drives.

Yamaha CRW-4416S (recommended)
     This is the next CD-RW generation of Yamaha drives. The same things
     apply as for the Yamaha CDR 2260/4260 drives.

Ricoh MP6200S (recommended)
     This is a new (as of 7/97) CD-RW drive. If you'ld like to be able
     to write up to 1000 times on a CD-RW, you should consider buying
     this drive.  Seems to be a good deal! People report they don't get
     any coasters when using this drive.

TEAC CDR50S, TEAC CDR55S
     We never had these drives, but the users who have one seem to be
     happy with it.

Plextor PX-R412 (depends)
     Seems to be a reliable drive but does not work with every SCSI
     hostadapter. Be careful!

JVC (be careful!)
     There are some people who really like their JVC drives, and
     others, who have nothing but problems. Although it obviously
     doesn't cause SCSI hangups, it sometimes reports strange errors
     and creates coasters. Seems to have problems caused by firmware
     bugs.

Ricoh 1420 / CDR_Plextor (be careful!)
     The Plextor drive totally confused our SCSI hostadapter. We don't
     know if Ricoh 1420 is better in this point.

Sony (be careful!)
     Sony CDU 926S won't be able to perform DAO writing. So it's good
     for TAO mode only. The drive we had got hangups when reading audio
     tracks while starting to read a new track.

Philips/HP (be careful!)
     Philips and HP drives don't work with every SCSI hostadpater.
     Sometimes, reselection problems appear, e.g. on A3000 or GVP
     hostadapters. This results in coasters. Additionally, the old
     Philips/HP generation (CDD 2000/HP 4020) suffer from hardware
     problems. Many of these drives need repair every few months. The
     new Philips/HP generation (CDD 2600/HP 6020) have problems when
     extrating audio data.

@{B}All CD writers we have heard of
-------------------------------@{UB}

This section lists all CD writers the authors of MakeCD have heard of.
Some of them are supported and tested by the authors or by customers,
others are untested (but should work in theory), some are still
unsupported, and others are unknown, which means that we don't know if
one of our drivers works with that drive or not.

Please note, that sometimes a CD writer is not compatible with a
specific Amiga SCSI system. In this case, you might have problems with
that CD writer -- e.g. it might block the SCSI bus, etc. This is not
the fault of MakeCD. Look out for tested systems.

The fact, that a device is listed here as tested, does @{B}not@{UB} mean that it
works on @{B}every@{UB} SCSI system. We are collecting experiences which
customers have made with several combinations of hardware.  See
@{"Working systems" Link "CSYSG"}, @{"Bad systems" Link "CSYSB"}.  @{B}Read these sections, too!@{UB} Please note
that some systems might appear on @{B}both@{UB} lists, which means that this
system works fine for one customer and causes problems for another one.

Each device name contained in this list is preceeded by a character to
give you a quick overview. This character means the following:

@{B}(T)@{UB}
     This device has been tested with MakeCD by the authors or by
     customers.  Although there might be SCSI problems in some cases,
     it should work in general.

@{B}(t)@{UB}
     This device had not yet been tested with MakeCD, but will most
     likely work anyway. If you have such a device, try it and tell us
     if it works or not!

@{B}(U)@{UB}
     This device is known, but not or not yet supported by MakeCD.

@{B}(?)@{UB}
     This device is not known. Maybe one of the MakeCD drivers supports
     it.  If you find out that such a device works with MakeCD, please
     tell us which driver you used to make it work. Thank you.

The following section lists all CD writers we have heard of in
alphabetical order. Many of them are not very popular. You will most
likely know only a few of them.

Mechanic does not look very stable. Tray often opens while transporting
the drive. Drive has a SPEED and a BUSY LED, a phone connector and a
volume control wheel at the front.

Firmware version 1.51 has problems with reading commands. CD-ROM
filesystems often report reading errors and the drive sometimes seems to
pass wrong data when reading. Seems like it does not do any error
checking. So don't expect you can use this drive with this firmware
version as a CD-ROM drive. Try firmware version 2.05 instead, which
seems to be much better!

You also have to expect problems with MultiSession CDs (with data
merging), because for data merging, some data must be read from CD.
Again, try firmware version 2.05.

There's another firmware version V1.52i. It appeared on internet, but is
for the JVC XR-W2020/2022 drives only.

MakeCD supports this CD writer. However, since the firmware of the JVC

configurations. See @{"JVC + TEAC Test Protocol" Link "CDR_TST_JVCTEAC"}.

This CD writer is very popular, although we can't really recommend it. A
lot of people reported hardware errors called `write append erros' and
similar things. They had to send in their drive to get it fixed. Have a
look at the MakeCD FAQ for further information about those problems.

Firmware is kept in flash ROM, so you can update it. But you need a PC
in order to do that.

Some SCSI hostadapters have SCSI trouble (reselection problem) with this
drive. Be prepared to switch off reselection for this CD writer. See
MakeCD-FAQ.

Some of the Philips CDD 2600 can't extract all audio tracks at full
speed. You have to slow down to 1x and 2x speed.

Philips CDD 2600 / Amiga 3000 caused reselection problems (SCSI
hangups).  That may also happen with other SCSI hostadapters. Be
prepared to switch off reselection for this CD writer. See MakeCD-FAQ.

It is recommended to use at least firmware version 1.0E for this drive.
The drive might eject CD-Rs if they are not yet supported by the
firmware. So be prepared that you have to update your firmware
(flashrom) eventually. It has been reported that you have to switch off

This is a very recommended CD writer. The authors of MakeCD are using
this CD writer (firmware version 1.12) for quite a while without any
trouble. Reading audio data works without problems in any speed. Writing
data and audio CDs is very reliable. Every SCSI hostadapter we tried
worked fine with this CD writer. Reselection works fine, too.

There are 5 LEDs in the front of this CD writer:

DISC, green
     Blinking while a new CD is being accepted. On when CD is accepted.

READ, green
     On while reading.

WRITE, orange
     On while writing. Blinking when writing in test mode.

2x, green
     On while working in 2x speed. Off while working in 1x or 4x speed.

4x, green
     On while working in 4x speed. Off while working in 1x or 2x speed.

We don't have exact information, but we think this device is almost the

     Note on the repair test:
@{I}          The CD-R was trashed by a CDR521, reported as `not writeable'
          in a Yamaha CDR 100 and not recognized at all by a Philips
          CDD 2000. With the Sony the target CD-R window showed one
          track covering the whole disc and told that "writing was
          interrupted". After repairing the track was reduced to its
          real size and the CD-R was writeable again. The track could
          be read, but not in the CDD 2000, which recognized the CD-R
          only once.

          With the Sony another track could be written and fixation was
          succesful. Now the CD-R is always recognized by the CDD 2000,
          too.  @{UI}

@{B}Working systems
===============@{UB}

Here follows a list that lists all systems that worked fine for some
users. Please note, that this list has been created by a lot of
different customers. Some of them know their Amiga very well and know
what they're writing -- others don't. Sometimes, a hardware combination
might work fine for one person and another person has a lot of trouble
with almost the same combination. Therefore, read also the list that
reports @{"bad" Link "CSYSB"} combinations! See @{"CD writers" Link "CCDWR"}, which contains a lot of
information about many CD writers.

If your system is not listed in the list of tested systems, look out for
entries in that list, that apply to a system that seems to be similar to
yours, except for the CD writer. Now use @{"Full list of CD writers" Link "CDR_FULL_LIST"} to
find out if the CD writer that is used in that configuration is
compatible to your CD writer.  Often, these CD writers are not only
compatible, they are even identical -- except the label on it!

I can write big image files from the IBM hard disk to CD-R in 4x speed.
I used to have trouble, but then I found out that my hard disk has been
prepped with the wrong mask value. After changing it to 0xfffffffc, I
can write in 4x speed without any trouble.

A made another test on a different A3000 (scsi.device 40.20 (18.02.94),

No SCSI problems. Reselection enabled for all devices, the hard disk
used synchron mode. An EIDE hard disk (WDC 2.1gig) was also in use.

Tests performed:

   · Audio tracks were read at single speed from both the Toshiba and
     the Yamaha and saved to the EIDE drive. Then an Audio CDR was
     written flawlessly using single speed again.

   · An image file was written (1x) to the CDR successfully.

   · Audio tracks were saved on EIDE hard disk and later written to CDR
     at double speed followed by audio tracks copied (1x) from CD-ROM to
     CD-Writer. The second session was written on-the-fly from the SCSI
     hard disk at double speed. It included a 300meg file. Perfect.

   · MakeCD and a CD-player played the Audio tracks of a fixed session
     although the CDR itself wasn't fixed.

Three coasters produced due to low quality CDRs. The buffer size used
for all these tests was 8 MB. While writing a CDR the buffer capacity
never dropped below 90% for direct writing, 99% when using an image
file. Even old CD-players play Audio-CDRs perfectly.

With this setup it is possible to get SCSI hangups when reading from a
CD-ROM and writing the ISO image to a file on a SCSI hard drive. This
is a common problem with earlier versions of the 1230scsi.device, using
version 8.1 or higher fixes this problem (SoftSCSI on Aminet can be
used to patch older ROMs.)

Tests performed:

   · Write an audio track direct from CD to CD-R at 1x speed. This
     worked perfectly.

   · Write an audio track direct from CD to CD-R at 2x speed. This
     failed with a buffer underrun using a 2x CD-ROM but works with a
     faster CD-ROM.

   · Write an audio track from CD to CD-R at 2x speed using an image
     file. This works perfectly, even if the image file is on a hard
     drive on the same SCSI controller as the CD writer.

   · Write a data track direct from CD to CD-R at 2x speed. Worked
     perfectly.

   · Write a data track from CD to CD-R at 2x speed using an image

   · Write a data track at 2x speed from a filesystem directly to CD-R.
     Works perfectly.

   · Write a data track at 2x speed from a filesystem using an image

     same SCSI controller as the CD writer.

The buffer size used for all these tests was 8 MB, the "Parallel
read/write" and "use ExAll" settings were both turned on and all hard
drive partitions have 1024 buffers.

This system caused the following problems using Fastlane ROM V7.120:

   · Reading  of  audio data causes data errors after 16-20 minutes and
     the drive makes noise (head positioning, change of the rotating
     speed)
     -> Philips hotline suggests to read with double speed. I could not
     test this yet, though.

   · Writing of data and audio tracks does not cause any problems, but
     it is not possible to fix the CD-R at the end. Repair mode worked
     without any problems.

   · You cannot use MCDPlayer to play an audio CD that is inserted in
     that drive.

   · Hint  of the Phase 5 hotline: switch off reselection at @{B}all@{UB}
     devices.

After updating Fastlane to ROM version 8.2, the problems disappeared,
except the problem in reading audio data (after 10 - 15 minutes, there's
a lot of garbage in the data stream). This is a problem of the Philips
CDD 2600 CD writer.

     maximum transfer rate I could achieve was 357KB/sec. This is just
     a bit too slow to be able to write in 2x speed. At the moment I am
     using Reselection off the writer, DMA on the Host adapter, 32kb
     chunks and sequential writing with a 12MB buffer while writing in
     only 1x speed, very disappointing after buying a 4x CD writer :-(.

Tips:
     Not many, it works (mostly) but you should always, ALWAYS write
     the WHOLE CD in test mode first. I have a very nice collection of
     "coasters" now so if you want to buy a "CD clock" as a present for
     someone you don't like, or a frisbee for the kids, I'm your man
     ;-).

Hints/Comments:
        · When I read the audio tracks at full speed (set 0 in the
          settings window), it happens that they have small errors,
          which sounds like when a CD player is jumping a bit. I can
          hear it only with really good audio equipment. Since I
          discovered those errors, I read audio tracks with single
          speed only. Perhaps it's just a subjective feeling, but the
          tracks now seem to be OK.

        · Sometimes AFS causes problems on both hard disks -- it waits
          for 4-8 seconds without doing anything, my tasks are hold for
          that time, and after that, everything works again. I didn't
          have these pauses when I was using FFS -- but AFS is far
          faster...

No SCSI hangups. 50 CDs written, 40 successful. The 10 coasters resulted
in either a frozen system or in strange error messages:

   · I was clicking in other windows when writing -- the system froze
     and I had to reboot (I am using a 16 bit deep workbench screen --
     perhaps that's the reason).

   · Error messages like "Medium Error 2, Illegal request" (sorry, I
     can't remember the exact texts) happened. My CD writer sends these
     error codes to MakeCD and then it refuses to finish or repair the
     CD-R. The strange thing is: if I don't change anything (I just
     insert another CD-R), it writes this CD-R without any problems. I
     tried 6 or 7 different CD-R types, e.g. TDK, FUJI, KOCH, even
     nonames, but it seems to me that it makes no difference.

   · On the other hand, I never had errors like buffer overflow or
     underrun, even if I write straight from a HDD in MS-DOS format,
     from my SCSI HDD or from my AT HDD to the CD writer. Sometimes,
     when I try to write directory trees that contain a few thousand
     @{B}very@{UB} small files, I have to increase the buffer size from
     8.000 KB to 24.000 KB to avoid getting a buffer underrun.

   · I tried to remove all my Commodities (MCP, NewMode, MagicMenu and
     others), but nothing changed.

     Other       :  changed some task prioritys (see hints for more)

Hints:
     At first the maximum transfer rate on the GVP was 352kb/s.That was
     enough to read / write CD-Rs safe in 2x speed. The reason for this
     slow transfer was, you can´t use DMA on the Host-Adapter without
     16bit-FastRAM (32bit-FastRAM the GVP can't use for DMA).

     After I set the Tooltype "GVPSCSICtrl ChipDMA" and the MakeCD
     environment variable "MAKECD_BUF_MEM_TYPE=1795" ($703 = 1795 =
     Attribute of ChipRAM), the maximum transfer rate increased to
     partly more than 720kb/s, because then the GVP uses ChipRAM (the
     only RAM within the 16bit-RAM area) for DMA.Although this transfer
     rate seemed to be enough for writing in 4x speed, sooner or later
     a buffer underrun appeared.

     Many long nights later I've found out,that if I raise the
     priorities of important SCSI tasks,  suddenly the whole thing
     works perfectly  (just unbelievable)! I've used a tool called
     "PriMan 2.0" for this job (Aminet/util/moni). My settings before
     and now:

     Task name                               Pri before      Pri now
     gvpscsi.device (GVP SCSI-Controller)    +5              +20
     scsi.device (VOB IDE-Controller)        +11             +20

     Using this settings,I achieve the following equal transfer rates
     with- out any buffer underrun:

     Writing in 4x speed: 690kb/s (+/-40kb)
     Reading from CD-R  : 800kb/s (+/-100kb)
     IDE-HD to Buffer   : 740kb/s (+/-40kb)

     Writing in 1x/2x/4x speed is no problem anymore, also reading data
     and audio tracks (using the CD-writer) with up to 6x speed! No
     panic about the 2MB only Chip-RAM-Buffer.  Ok, it isn't so much,
     but it works fine until now! I guess, if you change your SCSI
     priorities similar, your GVP will make it too!

     In the very next time I´ll try it again with an 8 MB extended
     GVP-Con- troller, see my then following test report, too.

     My ATAPI-CD-ROM can't read audio tracks (result: noise), but when
     I use the CD-writer for this, it works perfect.

     Other       :  changed some task prioritys (see hints for more)

Hints:
     After installing the GVP-Controller with 8 MB Fast-RAM onboard and
     using this (DMA-) RAM as buffer (see the settings obove), MakeCD
     reports a relatively equal data transfer rate (most of the time
     more than 700 kb/s). Nevertheless sooner or later a buffer
     underrun appears, especially when copying a CD with many small
     tracks.

     After setting the environment variable "MAKECD_PRI_WRITE=x"
     (x=different valu- es), the transfer rate increases to partly more
     than 1100kb/s (!), but the buffer underruns still remains.

     Many long nights later I've found out, that if I raise the
     prioritys of important SCSI-tasks, suddenly the whole thing works
     perfectly (just unbelievable)! I've used a tool called "PriMan
     2.0" for this job (Aminet/util/moni). My settings before and now:

     Task name                               Pri before      Pri now
     MakeCD_pri_write (Env-Variable)         +6              +20
     gvpscsi.device (GVP SCSI-Controller)    +5              +20
     scsi.device (VOB IDE-Controller)        +11             +20

     Using this settings,I achieve the following equal transfer rates
     without any buffer underrun:

     · Writing in 4x speed: 700kb/s (+/-20kb)
     · Reading from CD-R  : 900kb/s (+/-20kb)
     · IDE-HD to Buffer   : up to 1400kb/s (+/-100kb)
     . CD-ROM to Buffer   : up to 2100kb/s (+/-200kb)

     Writing in 1x/2x/4x speed is no problem anymore, also reading data
     and audio tracks (using the CD writer) with up to 6x speed!
     Changing these prioritys will help you  achieve similar equal
     transfer rates, if you have a GVP-Controller without 16bit FastRAM
     and so using ChipRAM for DMA, too.

@{B}Systems causing problems
========================@{UB}

Here follows a list that lists all systems, that didn't work for some
users. Please note, that this list has been created by a lot of
different customers. Some of them know their Amiga very well and know
what they're writing -- others don't. Sometimes, a hardware combination
might work fine for one person and another person has a lot of trouble
with almost the same combination. Therefore, read also the list that
reports @{"working" Link "CSYSG"} combinations! See @{"CD writers" Link "CCDWR"}, which contains a lot of
information about many CD writers.

If your system is not listed in the list of bad systems, look out for
entries in that list, that apply to a system that seems to be similar to
yours, except for the CD writer. Now use @{"Full list of CD writers" Link "CDR_FULL_LIST"} to
find out if the CD writer that is used in that configuration is
compatible to your CD writer.  Often, these CD writers are not only
compatible, they are even identical -- except the label on it! That's
how you can avoid to to the same mistake as another user did before.

If you tried everything to get your system to work with MakeCD, but if
you were still unsuccessful, email us to be included in this list.
Beside the information which you are supposed to mail is when you are
successful (see above), mail an exact description, which kind of error
occurs.

Hostadapter:
     Hostadapters using WD chip

CD writer:
     Plextor CD-R PX-R24CS V1.50

The WD Chip obviously causes problems with Plextor CD-R PX-R24CS V1.50.
However, if reselection is disabled, it seems to work. But since Plextor
uses only a very small buffer, it is "dangerous" to work without
reselection (watch the buffer display). If your source drive is
connected to a 2nd SCSI hostadapter, no problems are expected, though.
Or, if you get your data from a network (we were using Envoy
2.0/Ethernet and received our data from an A4000T), you probably won't
have problems, if the network connection is fast enough. We were able
to write in double speed with Envoy/Ethernet. We tried the Plextor in
the A4000T, too - without such problems, since the A4000T is based on
the NCR Chip and not on the WD, like the A3000 or GVP boards.

When using scsi.device version 40.20 on a A3000 (with A3640), the
machine crashed when accessing the device. We could fix this by
installing a new V43 beta scsi.device. See `ftp://ftp.amiga.de/'.

The problem I have is that the HP just refuses to function with cd-r in
it that has already been written.

If I write a CD (on win95) and it finishes ok, and I insert it again to
add an extra session the green led starts flashing like normal and after
a while it should be on all the time (like it does when I insert a
normal or blank CD) but the led goes dark and the whole CD writer is
does no longer respond to anything I tell it. (in scsi mounter error
reading device) and in the PEECEE, the writer software does no longer
recognize it.

It used to function ok but one day it did not work as it should anymore.
Today I heard from someone at work that he had upgraded the firmware
form 1.20 to 1.27 and I will ask him to trie and re install 1.20 and
then check if it will work. If not its defective if it does the 1.27
firmware is worse that the 1.20.

underflows sometimes when reading the data from the same SCSI

Philips CDD 2600 can read audio data in 6x speed without problems --
even the last audio track.

If reselection is @{B}on@{UB}, there are SCSI hangups sometimes. If you transfer
only one (e.g. ISO image) or a few (e.g. audio images) big image files,
SCSI hangups are very seldom. On-the-fly image creation however causes
SCSI hangups very often. After a SCSI hangup the SCSI LED of the A3000
is @{B}off@{UB}, and you can still access your hard drives, but any try to
access the Philips CDD 2600 hangs. If you try to abort MakeCD, it
reports that the writing process is waiting for IO to be finished. That
means that the Philips did not reply to a request sent by MakeCD.
