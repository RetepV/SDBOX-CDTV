CTRLscsi
========

This is a quick hack to display, enable or disable reselection for
individual or all units in scsi.device V39/V40. It sets values no
matter what is out there, so be careful. No warranties. Standard
disclaimer.

Note that disabling reselection via the Rigid Disk Block takes
precedence over the settings influenced via CTRLscsi.

Note also that due to bugs in scsi.device the following may happen:

    - Any access to a non existing LUN can turn on reselection for
      the respective ID with scsi.device >= 40.20.

    - Due to the above, e.g. any start of HDToolBox will turn on
      reselection, even on a single drive system.

Any access to non existing units will be ignored.


Legalese
========

This is not PD. It is freely redistributable, provided no changes
are made. CTRLscsi is giftware. If you like it and want to keep
using it, just send me a gift of your choice.
It shall not be sold for profit and may not be included with any
type of product without explicit permission by the author.

Permission has been granted to distribute CTRLscsi with MakeCD.


Sentiments
==========

I wouldn't have hacked this up if Angela hadn't spent some time
getting on my nerves for this. ;^)
