joycheck - utility for testing game controllers


warnifpressed - returns a non-zero WARN value if the specified
           game controller or joystick keys/directions are being
           pressed.  Uses lowlevel.library.  Could be useful

           on the button(s) a user is holding down.  Defaults
           to port 1 (the normal game controller port)

	Usage: warnifpressed button [button button...] [PORT0]

	Acceptable button names:
	RED(LMB) BLUE(RMB) GREEN YELLOW FORWARD(R_EAR) REVERSE(L_EAR) PLAY

        Example:

	if warn	; user is holding both RED and GREEN gamecontroller buttons
	  ; do something here
	else
	  ; do something else
	endif


warnifnotpal - returns a non-zero WARN value if a system is not a
	PAL system.  Could be useful for branching in a CD32
	startup-sequence or other script.
