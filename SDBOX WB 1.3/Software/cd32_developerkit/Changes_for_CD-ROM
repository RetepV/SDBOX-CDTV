The CD-ROM distribution of the CD³² Native Developer Kit contains a
number of changes from the original five disk set distribution. The
organization of drawers and disks has been preserved as closely as
possible. Here is the list of changes:

- Unpacked all archive files.

- Moved legal information text to CD-ROM top directory.

- Added icons to all included files.

- Added smakefiles to all sample programs in "CD32-Tools", "CD32_Support",
  "XL_Toolkit_1.1". All projects can be built using SAS/C 6.56 just by
  entering "smake". All executables were rebuilt using the provided
  smakefiles to verify that the build setup works.

- Added the BuildCD package.

- Removed debox.library from the distribution due to legal reasons.
