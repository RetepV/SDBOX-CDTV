FastFileSystem 40.4 (c) 1986-1999 Amiga, Inc. All Rights Reserved

This is a new version of the FastFileSystem for beta testing.  There have
been some significant changes made, so do not test this filesystem without
first backing up your data.  The changes are:

as of 40.4:

 - Should fix the longstanding lost bug where attempting to write
   data to a seek offset other than 0 to a write-protected disk,
   the data could be mistakenly written to the beginning of the file
   if the disk is un-writeprotected and reinserted.

as of 40.3:

 - Should remove the 8K and higher blocksize limit.  This should be
   beneficial for prepping and formatting of partitions which are used
   for streaming audio and video data capture and playback.  (Requires
   V40 HDToolbox to set higher block sizes before formatting)

 - Should solve the spurious checksum error problem with busy directories
   (those where deletes, exnexts, and writes all occuring all at once).
