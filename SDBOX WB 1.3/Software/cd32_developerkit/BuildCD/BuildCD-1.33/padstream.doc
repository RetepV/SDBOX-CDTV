Padstream

Tool to pad and align the sectors of a raw MPEG stream before cutting.
Use the VideoCD keyword if you have the Phillips spec and are trying to
make a real VideoCD that matches their VideoCD spec.  The VideoCD keyword
adds two seconds of blank video to the beginning of the MPEG.

Usage: Padstream Source/A,Dest/A,VideoCD/S


Notes on MPEG (see also BuildCD .doc for list of MPEG encoding services):


To include a properly encoded and interleaved SIF format MPEG track on a
CD32 disc...

1 - Be sure that the MPEG file is properly encoded and interleaved to comply
    with the VideoCD standard.  Things to check for...

    a - Encoded at the proper VideoCD bit-rates for audio and video.

    b - Audio and Video properly interleaved for VideoCD

    c - Ready to be written as Mode 2 Form 2 data (properly padded for
        Mode 2 Form 2 sector size.)

    d - Two seconds of blank sectors at head of data.  (only strictly
        necessary for files that will be played by the ROM player
        interface.)

    If either "c" or "d" above are either not true or unsure, run the
    "padstream" program on the MPEG data file.

    Command format:
        PadStream Source/A,Dest/A,VideoCD/S
        Where source is the name of the file in question, Dest is the
        file that will be written, and VideoCD is a command line switch
        that should be used if the file will be part of a VideoCD
        compliant disc that is intended to be played by the ROM VideoCD
        player program.

2 - Use ISOCD to build your data file as normal.

3 - Use BuildCD 1.31 or greater to cut track 1 as data (with your ISOCD
    generated ISO image as the data file), and tracks 2-99 as either
    audio and/or MPEG tracks.  Be sure to specify MPEG for MPEG tracks
    and Audio for Audio tracks.
