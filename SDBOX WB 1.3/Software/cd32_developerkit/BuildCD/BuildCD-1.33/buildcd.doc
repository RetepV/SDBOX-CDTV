Notes about BuildCD
===================
(c) Copyright 1993-1999 Amiga, Inc.  All Rights Reserved
Confidential.


The BuildCD software allows you to cut "gold disc" CD-ROMs using an
Amiga and a Phillips CDD-521 write-once CD-ROM cutter from data files
which have been prepared for CD-ROM such as an ISO-9660 image file,
MPEG tracks, and CD Audio tracks.

BuildCD features:

o Easy-to-use gadtools interface
o Cuts 0 or 1 Data tracks first, and any number of Audio or MPEG tracks
  in any order
o Displays CD space and time used for all tracks
o Loads and saves track sheets for frequestly cut titles


Required Hardware
=================

You will need an Amiga with very fast SCSI, fast SCSI harddisks
with lots of storage space, a Philips CDD 521 Compact Disk Recorder
(which can cost up to $5000), plus blank gold disks.


The following Amiga configurations haved been tested:

1. 25MHz A3000
2. A4000 [25MHz MC68040, 8Mb FAST RAM] with the A4091 or FastLane
   SCSI-2 host adapters.

We have not tested with an A2000/A2091.

The Philips drive requires a steady uninterrupted 300K/second sustained
transfer rate.  We do not know if this is possible with the any hardware
other than what we have tested.

Hard Disk Drives
================

For harddisk space, you will need approximately 3x the amount of space
your source data takes up, with 1/3 of that on a partition which can be
reformatted often and which can hold all of your final data for your CD.

We have successfully cut disks with samples of the following drives:

o Seagate/Imprimis/CDC Wren IV,VI,VII
o Seagate ST11200
o Maxtor "Magic" 540, 1240

Reselect
========

Important!!!  The Philips drive can not deal with other drives that have
Reselect On.  If a drive with Reselect On is on the bus when cutting
disks, you will get errors and will cut a bad disk.  You must be sure
that all SCSI devices on the bus have Reselect OFF.  For harddisks, this
can generally be accomplished with the ReselectOff script and icon
(ignore the error output for unit numbers you don't have).  For some
drives and other SCSI devices, you may have to consult the documentation
which came with the device to see if there is a jumper for reselection.
The Fish Disk tool "RDBInfo" (Disk 779) may be used to check the reslection
state of individual SCSI units.


Other Required Software/Hardware
================================
You need to create the data for your disk and get it into a standard
CD-ROM format before you can use BuildCD to place the data on the disk.

Suggested tools for getting your data in CD-ROM formats:

- ISO Image (data track)
  For the Amiga, use the Amiga ISOCD program which AmigaCD licensees
  receive without charge.  Only the Amiga ISOCD program can create
  a bootable disk for CDTV or CD32.  Only licensees may have and use
  this program.  Commodore subsidiaries and other licensees may not
  build title disks for a developer unless the developer or publisher
  has signed an AmigaCD license and amendment for that title.

  For other systems (Mac and PC), there are commercial software
  packages available for building ISO image files.  These packages
  can not build a bootable Amiga CD32 disk.

- Audio tracks
  Digitize with the Studio-16 sampler, and then use the tool called
  "Conversion" by Jim Hawkins to place the sound sample bytes
  in the correct order for a CD track.

- MPEG tracks
  We have these made by providing our video to a company that converts
  our video to MPEG.  See the list of some MPEG services at the end of
  this document.  Before cutting the MPEG binary you receive from the
  MPEG service, you may need to align and pad it properly by making
  a copy of the stream with the tool called "Padstream".  


CCOPY
=====

CCopy must be used to copy your CD-ready data (ISO image, audio tracks,
mpeg tracks) to a clean FastFileSystem partition (we'll call this the
"build" partition).  You then use BuildCD to cut the CD from the data
on your build partition.

CCopy is a special version of COPY which attempts to place files
in a manner optimal for sustained reads when transferring to the Philips
drive.  For CCopy to work properly, it must be used to copy data to an
Amiga FastFileSystem partition which is either freshly formatted,
OR has never had files deleted from it.  (i.e. you can CCopy multiple
ISO images, audio tracks, MPEG tracks, etc. to a fresh FFS partition
as long as you don't delete any files from the partition.  Deleting files
would leave a fragmented disk structure and subsequent CCopy'ed
files would not be laid down contiguously, possibly making it
impossible to sustain the transfer rate needed to cut a CD).

If possible, use the V40 Amiga filesystem on this partition and use
V40 HDToolbox to set the block size for the partition to 2048 instead
of 512.  Do this before formatting the partition.  Note - to make sure
the partition is actually using the 2048 blocksize, use the CLI "Info"
command after formatting and multiply the number of free blocks shown
by 2048 and make sure the result is close to the size of the partition
in bytes.  Use of 2048-size blocks will allow BuildCD to read the data
more quickly from your drive when cutting the CD.

MPEG
====

To include a properly encoded and interleaved SIF format MPEG track on a
CD32 disc...

1 - Be sure that the MPEG file is properly encoded and interleaved to comply
    with the VideoCD standard.  Things to check for...

    a - Encoded at the proper VideoCD bit-rates for audio and video.

    b - Audio and Video properly interleaved for VideoCD

    c - Ready to be written as Mode 2 Form 2 data (properly padded for
        Mode 2 Form 2 sector size.)

    d - Two seconds of blank sectors at head of data.  (only strictly
        necessary for files that will be played by the ROM player
        interface.)

    If either "c" or "d" above are either not true or unsure, run the
    "padstream" program on the MPEG data file.

    Command format:
        PadStream Source/A,Dest/A,VideoCD/S
        Where source is the name of the file in question, Dest is the
        file that will be written, and VideoCD is a command line switch
        that should be used if the file will be part of a VideoCD
        compliant disc that is intended to be played by the ROM VideoCD
        player program.

2 - Use ISOCD to build your data file as normal.

3 - Use BuildCD 1.31 or greater to cut track 1 as data (with your ISOCD
    generated ISO image as the data file), and tracks 2-99 as either
    audio and/or MPEG tracks.  Be sure to specify MPEG for MPEG tracks
    and Audio for Audio tracks.


MPEG ENCODING
=============
o What is the cost for MPEG encoding ?

Costs vary from between $60/min (Laser Pacific, if you tell them you're
a CD-I developer) and $170/min (Philips if you tell them you're a CD32
developer.)

o Are their any Micro based MPEG encoding solutions?

None yet that have the quality of a professional encoding job.  There
is a software based solution from a company called Helfrich in Germany.
It works using their Piccollo graphics card.  The software does a pretty
good job, but you obviously have to be willing to let it sit a long time
with each frame if you want decent quality.

We've heard that there are some PC solutions in the works, but haven't
actually seen anything available yet.
