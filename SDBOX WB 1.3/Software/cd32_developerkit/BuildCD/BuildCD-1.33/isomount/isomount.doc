s/isomount script and devs/fmsdisk.device
=========================================

The files here are a modified Dillon fmsdisk.device (original sources on
Fish Disk 94) and script called "isomount".

Used with the Amiga V40 CDFilesystem, you can easily mount an ISO image
file for examination without having to rename the file to "Unit<n>" or
assign "FMS:"  (I modified fmsdisk.device to first look for an environment
variable called FMSUnit<n> containing the full path to the ISO file you
wish to mount. The isomount script creates that env variable and a mountlist,
and mounts the ISO file)

To use:
Put fmsdisk.device in devs: and isomount in s: (and CDFilesystem should
already be in L: - I have only tested this under V40)

Simple usage (mounts your ISO file as ISO2: fmsdisk.device unit #2):

     isomount isofilename

If you want to mount additional ISO images, you must supply a unit
   number other than the default of 2, for example:

     isomount isofilename unitnum=3

NOTE - the mount may take a while with harddisk light on (FS or WB
reading file or something - who knows).  Wait until HD light goes off
before accessing ISO2: or its volumename.

NOTE - It is possible that isomount does not work properly on files
in RAM: or files with spaces in their names or files on volumes with spaces
in their names.  Symptom is "No disk in drive"
