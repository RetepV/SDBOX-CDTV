CCOPY's usage is just like the Amiga C directory COPY command.

At its simplest, the usage is: CCOPY srcfile destfile

The difference is that CCOPY, when used to copy to a freshly formatted
partition (or at least a partition where files have only been CCOPY'd to
and files have never been deleted or modified), CCOPY will attempt to
make the files as contiguous as possible with all file extension blocks
at the beginning.  This should allow BuildCD to read the file quickly
and smoothly to maintain the transfer rate required for cutting a CD
from the data being read.
