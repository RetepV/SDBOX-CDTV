Generally, ISO only supports directory structures up to 8 levels deep.

If you think you might have some directories deeper than that, you can
use the "howdeep" tool to get a list of the directories which are
deeper than a specified depth (threshold).

Usage: howdeep volume|directory threshold

Example: howdeep Work: 7
