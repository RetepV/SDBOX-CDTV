This is an example of CDXL with audio "Sound on Film".

To play it:

        COPY df0:#? <harddisk>

        CD <harddisk>

        XLPlay callnow -r4


Note that playback from a hard disk is only approximate.  You might hear
"sound clipping", as well as an irregular playback rate.  If so, try
copying the sequence to the RAM: disk, and playing back from there.

These problems do not appear when playing this file from a CD in a CDTV
player.
