Additional Programs:

        XLIFF
                Will take a pan file and convert requested frames to
                individual IFF files for use with your favorite paint
                programs.  These files are named according to
                a simple convention:
                "File" will produce "File.0001", "File.0002", etc.
                "File.001" will produce "File.001","File.002", etc.
                -f (first), -l (last), -n (number of frames) specifies
                what frames are produced and -u will create IFF files
                that are uncompressed.
                If an output name is not given, the input file name is
                used as the base name.

Additional Features:

        The "pan.h" standard include file has been updated to permit
        new video encoding formats.  Most standard formats are now
        supported for both "raw" and "processed" video.

        Support for interleaved image data (PIF_LINES).  Planes are
        interleaved on a line rather than image basis. This allows for
        a single blit which results in increased speed during CDXL
        playback (See: AmigaWorld Tech. Journal)

        Support for pad data.  A given frame may include padding to change
        its playback to an easier to handle rate.  Padding may also be
        used to include other information with each frame, and the tools
        will preserve this data.

        XLMake supports the same base name logic that XLIFF uses.  This
        allows automated conversion of IFF files.

        XLCopy provides for single frame copy (-s).

        XLPlay now produces more accurate audio playback with a variable
        buffering technology.  These buffers can be increased if the file
        is stored over too many dos extents.

        XLPlay can start play at a particular frame (-f) and stop at a
        frame (-l) or play a certain number of frames (-n).

        XLInfo can now ignore size errors (-e option) when extra padding
        has been added to the frames.

        Example.c includes the buffering logic and code to handle audio.

Bug Fixes:

        More than 16 iff files for XLMake or XLJoin, would mistake the
        17th file for the XL file.

        XLInfo is now more clear when reporting improper sizes.

        XLMake was not checking CAMG chunk to guess HAM or EHB!

        XLPlay did not center screens correctly under 2.0 when other views
        where available.  New method works under all cases.

        XLPlay & XLJoin now handle initial memory allocations more
        efficiently.

        XLMake's activity printout now conforms to the "look & feel" of
        the rest of the tools.

        If there is enough memory, writes are buffered.

        XLTrim option -e1 did not work.

        Example was not cleaning up correctly. CloseDevice...

        XLPlay now returns old audio interrupt and asks audio.device for the
        two channels.

        LoadRGB4 was too time consuming for Example.c, so a copy of a
        correctly produced copper list is used and colors manually added
        to allow for additional time.

        XLInfo no longer accepts odd sized values for audio info.

        XLInfo -w was printing last frame twice if last was different.

        XLPlay was not closing IntuitionBase.

        XLPlay would pause on a frame if it was supposed to be displayed
        faster than 1/60th of a second.

        Added checking for CHUNKY/BYTE in XLIFF and XLPlay (where they
        can't currently handle these types)
