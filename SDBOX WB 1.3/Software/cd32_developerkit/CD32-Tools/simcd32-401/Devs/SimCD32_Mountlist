/*
 * CD-ROM file system entry
 *
 * This file enables the CD-ROM file system which allows you to read standard
 * ISO-9660 images off of a hard drive using the SimCD32 developer tool.
 * Use this mount list if you are using the FROM keyword:
 *
 * > mount cd0: FROM devs:CD0_Mount.
 *
 * Note that this uses CDFileSystem_40.8. Which is a version of CDFileSystem
 * which does NOT use any 2.0 packets. This is better for emulation as the
 * ROM CD32 CDFileSystem does NOT use any 2.0 packets.
