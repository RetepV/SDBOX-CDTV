   NAME
        SimCD32 - A cd.device/CDROM simulator.

   SYNOPSIS
        SimCD32 ISOIMAGE:

   FUNCTION
        Simulate a cd.device/CDROM envirnoment.

   INPUTS
        ISOIMAGE     - The complete path to the isoimage to be mounted
                       as a simulated CDROM.

   RESULTS
        The specified isoimage will be used as the CDROM isoimage.


   NOTES
        To kick the CDROM simulation to life, from the shell type:

        > run SimCD32 work:isoimage
        > mount cd0: FROM devs:SimCD32_Mountlist

        Notice that after SimCD32 is run, cd0: must be manually mounted
        with the mount command. You may need to use the FROM keyword to point
        mount to the proper amiga mountlist. Here is a mountlist which can
        be used to mount CD0:

        CD0:
                Device          = cd.device
                Unit            = 0
                Activate        = 1
                FileSystem      = L:CDFileSystem_40.8
                Flags           = 0
                Surfaces        = 1
                SectorsPerTrack = 1
                SectorSize      = 2048
                Mask            = 0x7ffffffe
                MaxTransfer     = 0x100000
                Reserved        = 0
                Interleave      = 0
                LowCyl          = 0
                HighCyl         = 0
                Buffers         = 5
                BufMemType      = 0
                StackSize       = 1000
                Priority        = 10
                GlobVec         = -1
                DosType         = 0x43443031
        #

        Note that this uses CDFileSystem_40.8. Which is a version of CDFileSystem
        which does NOT use any 2.0 packets. This is better for emulation as the
        ROM CD32 CDFileSystem does NOT use any 2.0 packets.

        Once SimCD32 is run, and cd0: is mounted, you may access cd0: in the
        normal fashion:

        > list cd0:
        etc.

        You may also run CDXL files off of the simulated cd.device/CDROM in
        the same manor in which you'd do this in a real cd.device/CDROM
        envirnoment.

        SimCD32 has an ARexx port, named SimCD32, supporting the following commands.

           Quit         -- Causes SimCD32 to exit.

           GetISOName   -- Returns the file name of the current ISO image.

           SetISOName   -- Sets the ISO image to the given file (must provide
                           the complete path name). This can be used to change
                           the image that is mounted, (say from work:isoimage
                           to work:isoimage2, or whatever).
