SimCD32 is a developer tool which enables developers to simulate
the presence of a CDROM drive (cd0:) on their development machines,
and to emulate the functionality of cd.device. This allows application
testing from the development Amiga, bypassing the need to cut a CD. The
command synopsis is:

SimCD32 ISOIMAGE:

where isoimage is the COMPLETE path to the isoimage on the hard drive.

To enable the cd.device/CDROM simulation, from the shell type:

> run SimCD32 work:isoimage
> mount cd0: FROM devs:SimCD32_Mountlist

Notice that after SimCD32 is run, cd0: must be manually mounted
with the mount command. You may need to use the FROM keyword to point
mount to the proper amiga mountlist. Here is a mountlist which can
be used to mount CD0:

CD0:
        Device          = cd.device
        Unit            = 0
        Activate        = 1
        FileSystem      = L:CDFileSystem_40.8
        Flags           = 0
        Surfaces        = 1
        SectorsPerTrack = 1
        SectorSize      = 2048
        Mask            = 0x7ffffffe
        MaxTransfer     = 0x100000
        Reserved        = 0
        Interleave      = 0
        LowCyl          = 0
        HighCyl         = 0
        Buffers         = 5
        BufMemType      = 0
        StackSize       = 1000
        Priority        = 10
        GlobVec         = -1
        DosType         = 0x43443031
#

Note that this uses CDFileSystem_40.8. Which is a version of CDFileSystem
which does NOT use any 2.0 packets. This is better for emulation as the
ROM CD32 CDFileSystem does NOT use any 2.0 packets.

Once SimCD32 is run, and cd0: is mounted, you may access cd0: in the
normal fashion:

> list cd0:
etc.

You may also run CDXL files off of the simulated cd.device/CDROM in the same
manor in which you'd do this in a real cd.device/CDROM envirnoment.

SimCD32 has an ARexx port, named SimCD32, supporting the following commands.

   Quit         -- Cause SimCD32 to exit.

   GetISOName   -- Returns the file name of the current ISO image.

   SetISOName   -- Set the ISO image to the given file (must provide the
                   complete path name and whole command must be in quotes).
                   This can be used to change the image that is mounted,
                   (say from work:isoimage to work:isoimage2).
                   Example:
                          "SetISOName work:isoimage2"
                   Note that ARexx requires the quotes.

An interactive ARexx script, SimCD32.rexx, has been provided for experimenting
with SimCD32's ARexx commands.
