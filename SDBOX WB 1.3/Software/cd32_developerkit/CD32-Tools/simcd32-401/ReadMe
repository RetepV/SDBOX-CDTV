This archive contains AmigaCD32 simulation tools. Uncompress this
to a bootable floppy. Edit the s/startup-sequence to point SimCD32
to an ISOimage on your hard drive. Booting off of this floppy, simulates
how your application would run when boot off of the AmigaCD32.

See the ReadME and .doc files in the SimCD32 and SimCD32Env directories
for more info.
